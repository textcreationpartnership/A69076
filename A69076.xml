            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any haue bin ſorrie (good Reader) to ſee ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of this learned and godly Author come forth in publike, ſince his death, with ſo many defects and maimes. To giue an inſtance hereof, there is an expoſition of the Epiſtle to the Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, publiſhed vnder his name; wherein hee hath had very much wrong done to him: it being nothing elſe but a bundle of raw and imperfect notes, taken by ſome vnlearned hearer, neuer peruſed (or ſo much as ſeene) by the Author himſelfe. Wherein there is ſcant any good coherence of matter to be found, or any perfect periods and ſentences handſomly knit together, or ſutably depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one vpon another.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe of Religion, now reprinted, was the firſt; whereof of there was much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
<pb facs="tcp:7884:3"/> and deſire; as of that which would be of more generall vſe to all ſorts of people: in which reſpect the Author himſelf was known to make more account of it, and would (if God had prolonged his daies to haue perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the ſame according to his own wiſhes) haue giuen fuller ſatisfaction to his iudicious and impartiall Reader. His purpoſe was, to ſet downe in moſt plaine and familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all the neceſſarie points of poſitiue Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereunto God (in a gratious meaſure) hath inabled him; as may appeare euen by the firſt impreſſion, though it were publiſhed with many wants and imperfections.</p>
            <p>What paines and faithfulneſſe hath been vſed in this ſecond edition, for the ſupply of defects, and amendment of the faults of the former, will appeare to them that ſhall take time and paines to compare them together.</p>
            <p>His helpe was principally vſed herein, who was well acquainted with the Author and his purpoſe; and who hath done no more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in effect, then what he had helpe in, either from the Authors owne little Catechiſme, or from ſome directions in the beſt and laſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie that he left behind him, or which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
<pb facs="tcp:7884:3"/> of the method which he propounded did require.</p>
            <p>The firſt edition (as appeares) wanted a beginning; by meanes whereof the whole worke was as the trunke of a body without the head; the reaſon whereof was the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the doctrine of the Scripture, (wherewith he firſt began the Treatiſe) into a more fit place; this as neare as can bee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Authors mind and ſpeciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is ſupplied in the firſt Chapter: the like tranſpoſition of other particulars, not well vnderſtood by his ſeruant that copied forth the booke, afterwards was a cauſe of the multitude of other errours alſo, which wee hope are now ſufficiently amended, all particulars being brought to their proper places. Only there is in the expoſition of the laſt petition of the Lords Prayer, a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Gods gouernment concerning ſinne; which were to bee wiſhed had been brought backe to the tenth Chapter, which is the firſt and fitteſt place for that argument to bee handled in: and alſo whether by the Printers negligence, or his that writ the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, there is one whole queſtion and anſwere
<pb facs="tcp:7884:4"/> which belongs to the latter end of the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, placed out of order, and ſet in the beginning of the eighteenth Chapter. There are alſo (to my griefe) many other verball faults which the Printer and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber muſt diuide betweene them, which though they may bee eaſily diſcerned by the iudicious and aduiſed Reader, yet may make others to ſtumble; and therfore I earneſtly pray thee good Reader (which thou eaſily maieſt doe) that thou wouldeſt amend them in the firſt place, according to the direction following.</p>
            <p>Further thou art to be entreated that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after thou eſteeme nothing to bee his, but what ſhall bee publiſhed or approued by them, to whom by his laſt will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament hee committed the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and examination of his writings. Farewell.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Hereby is ſet forth the manner of the Being and Eſſence of God, farre otherwiſe then is vſuall in the proper names of men; which declare either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or very little of their nature and being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there nothing of God to be knowne, beſides that which is ſignified by this Name?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very well: for the ſinne was horrible and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold, being firſt a doubting of the truth of God.

Fourthly, intolerable pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, in deſiring to bee equall in knowledge to God himſelfe.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is compared to a ſtroke that lighteth vpon the hart or ſoule of a man, where the wound is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 4. 5. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is farre otherwiſe: for whether a man know it or no, his guiltremaineth: as debt is debt, although
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7884:39"/> the perſon indebted know it not, and it is by ſo much more dangerous, as not knowing it; hee will neuer bee carefull to ſeeke after the meanes to diſcharge it, till the Lords arreſt bee vpon his backe, when his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will doe him no good.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, it were wiſedome, not to ſuffer it to runne long on the ſcore; but to reckon with our ſelues euery night, ere wee lie downe to ſleepe, and looke backe to to the doings of that day: that in thoſe things that are well done, we may be thankfull, and comfort our own hearts; and in that which hath paſſed otherwiſe from vs, we may call for mercy, that ſo our ſleepe may be the ſweeter. For if (as <hi>Salomon</hi> aduiſeth vs) in the caſe of <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the 1. and 2. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to the <hi>Galathians, Epheſians, Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Coloſsians,</hi> the 1. and 2. to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> the 1. and 2. to <hi>Timothie,</hi> to <hi>Titus, Philemon,</hi> the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the Epiſtle of <hi>Iames,</hi> the 2.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How may theſe bookes bee diſcerned to bee the word of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By theſe conſiderations following: Firſt, they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30. 5. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 8.</note> are perfectly holy in themſelues, and by themſelues: whereas all other writings are prophane, further then they draw holineſſe from theſe; which yet is neuer ſuch, but that their holineſſe is imperfect and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are perfectly profitable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21.</note> to inſtruct to ſaluation, and all other are vtterly vnprofitable thereunto, any further then they draw from them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is a perfect concord and harmonie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 22.</note> in all theſe Bookes, notwithſtanding the diuerſity of perſons by whom, places where, and times when, and matters whereof, they haue been written.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is an admirable <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12.</note> force in them, to incline mens hearts from vice to vertue.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in great <note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. 18. 21. 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 15. 1, <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21.</note> plaineneſſe and eaſineſſe of ſtile, there ſhineth a great Maieſty and authority.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, there is ſuch a gracious ſimplicity in the writers of theſe Bookes, that they neither ſpare their friends, nor themſelues, but moſt freely, and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſet downe their owne faults and infirmities as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7884:43"/> well as others.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Gods owne Spirit working in the harts of his children doth aſſure them, that theſe Scriptures are the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it agreed vpon, that theſe Bookes are alone in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Bookes of Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Concerning the Bookes of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is generally agreed, that all they, and that they alone are of that account: But the Church of Rome holdeth, that diuers other books, (called Apocrypha) doe belong to the Old Teſtament, and are of the ſame authority with the other that haue been named.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By what reaſons may this errour of theirs bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By theſe: Firſt, they were not written at the firſt in the Hebrew tongue, in which, all the authenticall Bookes of the Old Teſtament were originally written.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Iewes (to whom the Oracles of God <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> were committed, vnder the Old Teſtament) haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and kept theſe onely as Canonicall, and the Oracles of God, and not the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe onely were read and expounded in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15.</note> their Synagogues, and not the other.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Primitiue Churches after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, (both Greek and Latine) did receiue theſe Books onely for Canonicall Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat worthie vſe and effect of theſe bookes of holy Scripture, doth the Apoſtle ſet forth in this place?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This, that they are able to make a man wiſe to <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 17.</note> Saluation, through faith in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth that appeare?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, for that God is the Author of them, who is for his wiſdome, able; &amp; for his loue to his Church,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7884:44"/> willing, to ſet downe ſuch a Rule as may guide them fully and perfectly to eternall Life. Secondly, for that it is profitable, to teach all true doctrine, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the falſe; to correct all diſorder, priuate, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and to informe men throughly in the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. Thirdly, for that the Miniſter of the Word is ſaid thereby, to be made compleat and perfect to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery dutie of the Miniſterie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth this laſt reaſon hold?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very ſtrongly: for more being required of a Miniſter, that is to bee the eye and mouth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then of the people themſelues; if it be ſufficient to make him perfect, it is much more able to giue them ſufficient Inſtruction. And ſeeing the Miniſter is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27.</note> bound to diſcloſe the whole Counſell of God to his people, &amp; may be therunto fully furniſhed out of the treaſurie of the Word of God; it followeth that they alſo out of the Scriptures may be abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly taught to Saluation; &amp; need not elſewher to ſeek for any ſupply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat other things doe you gather from theſe cauſes, properties and effects of Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that it alone being able and ſufficient to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 9.</note> make vs wiſe to Saluation, we need no vnwritten Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, no Traditions of men, no Canons of Councels, or Sentences of Fathers; much leſſe Decrees of Popes, to ſupply any ſuppoſed defect of the written Word of God, or to giue vs a more perfect direction in the way of life, then is already ſet downe expreſſely in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat elſe learne you from thence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I learne further, (eſpecially from this, that they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 48. <hi>Galath.</hi> 1. 9.</note> they are inſpired of God): 1. That they are of diuine authority. 2. That they are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule, the line, the ſquyre,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7884:44"/> and light, wherby to examine and trie all iudgements and ſayings of men, and of Angels, whether they bee ſuch as God approueth, yea or no; &amp; that they are not to be iudged or ſentenced by any. And therfore that the Church of Rome, who hangeth the credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures on the Churches ſentence, doth therein offer horrible iniurie and indignity vnto God, making thereby the Churches word, of greater credit and authority then the Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What further doe you learne from hence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I learne from hence (and eſpecially in that it is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19 9.</note> ſaid to be a rule and a line) that it is firme and ſtable, and changeth not: and therefore is as a rule of ſteele, and not (as the Church of Rome blaſphemouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth) like a rule of lead, which may be bowed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way at mens pleaſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But it ſeemeth the Scriptures are darke, and hard to be vnderſtood, and therefore that the reading of them is not to be permitted vnto the common people, but vnto thoſe onely that are learned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The direct contrary is taught by the Apoſtle, when he affirmeth, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was nouriſhed vp in the Scriptures from his infancie. For if they be ſo pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that little children may profitably reade them, there is none ſo groſſe (which hath the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a man) but may profit by them; comming in the feare of God, and with inuocation of his name, to the reading and hearing of them.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> HItherto wee haue heard of the Doctrine of the Scriptures what they are, and what are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, properties, and effects of them; as being they, from whom onely all Doctrine concerning our ſaluation, is to bee drawne and deriued: What are the parts of that Doctrine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Either the doctrine of workes, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Law: or of Grace, called <hi>the Promiſe;</hi> and ſince the comming of Chriſt, the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> as appeareth by this Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the drift of this Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It ſheweth two waies of recouering happines; the one by the workes of the Law, the other by faith in the promiſe of grace: and that the Law is not that way, whereby we can receiue the Happineſſe we haue loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is that ſhewed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For that the promiſe of grace, whereby <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was iuſtified, was 430. yeeres before the Law; and therefore that the Law which commeth after, cannot make void the Couenant of Grace; which it ſhould doe, if a man were iuſtified by the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But it may be ſaid, that the Iuſtification by Workes of the Law, doth not make void the Promiſe of Grace, when as the matter is ſo handled, as Saluation commeth in part by the Workes of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily, it is made void notwithſtanding: for if Saluation were before the Law was, onely by Grace; and now ſhould be by Works and Grace: then the promiſe giuen to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of Grace onely, ſhould bee made void. And therefore the Apoſtle in the 18. verſe doth ſhew, that if it bee of the Law, it cannot bee by the promiſe of Grace. Yea the Law is ſo farre from
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7884:46"/> bringing ſaluation, that through the corruption of our nature, it encreaſeth ſinne in vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then it ſhould ſeeme that there is no vſe of the Law, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it doth not iustifie vs, either in all, or in part?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not ſo: for it was giuen to ſhew and diſcouer ſinne, and in that regard to terrifie and affright vs, and driue vs from all confidence in our ſelues: as alſo to ſerue as a rule, whereby wee are to direct and amend our liues.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. By the teſtimony of the Apoſtle, ſaying, that <hi>by the Law commeth the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> 2. By the <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat obſerue you from that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the Law is terrible vnto vs, by reaſon of the guilt of our ſins; and that it driueth vs to ſeeke for a Mediator, which is Chriſt alone, who is heere figured in the Mediation of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If the promiſe of Grace take away ſinne, and the Law encreaſe ſinne; if it take away the conſcience of ſinne, and this doth cauſe a conſcience and remorſe of ſinne; it ſeemeth that the Law is contrary to the promiſe of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not a whit: for the Law would alſo take away ſinne, and the conſcience of ſin, if any man were able perfectly to obſerue it; for the Law of it ſelfe cauſeth no ſinne, but onely by accident, by reaſon of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: <note place="margin">

                  <hi>A.</hi> The Apoſtle compareth the Law to a Iuſtice of Peace, or a Sergeant which arreſteth ſuch as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23.</note> the ſame, and laieth them in priſon; not that they ſhould periſh there, with hunger, cold, or other annoyances of the priſon: but that when they feele their miſerie, and diſcerne, that of themſelues, and by their owne deſerts they cannot get out of it, they ſhould thereby be moued the more earneſtly, to ſeeke after the free pardon and grace of the Prince. And therefore it is not contrary to the promiſe of grace, but a ſpeciall helpe towards the obtaining thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is this further cleared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By this, that the Apoſtle compareth the Law to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23.</note> a Garriſon, which is ſet in a towne, to keepe ſuch Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof in awe and ſeruitude, as haue not loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally-affected mindes to their Prince; to the end, that in time, they comming to a iuſt and dutifull obedience, may be freed from the awe and ſeruitude of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> How elſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is compared to a Tutor, or Guardian. For as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24.</note> hee keepeth the child that is vnder age ſtraitly, by meanes whereof he hath a deſire to bee out of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and to enioy the liberty of a ſonne: ſo after the <note place="margin">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7884:47"/> thereof, moueth vs with the more ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſeeke after Chriſt. Moreouer, as a Tutor or Vſher directeth the ſteps of the child, and inſtructeth him in ſuch courſes of life, by which hee is afterwards to liue: ſo the Law, after it hath brought vs to Chriſt, directeth vs in the way wee haue to walke in this life, to life euerlaſting: ſo that it hath two notable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie effects; one as a ſpurre to chaſe vs vnto Chriſt, the other as a light to direct and teach vs how to walke, when wee are come vnto him. Laſtly, as a Tutor, it humbleth vs, whiles by means therof we vnderſtand, how farre wee are from fulfilling the ſame; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, how vnable wee are by the workes of the Law, (which alone are good works) to free our ſelues from the curſe of the Law.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a Doctrine commanding the perfection of Godlineſſe, and Righteouſneſſe, binding vs to eternal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 32. 42.</note> death for our leaſt defect therein; which Law is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at large throughout the whole Scripture, but is ſummarily contriued, firſt into ten words, or ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37.</note> written by Gods owne finger at the firſt, in Tables of ſtone: to ſignifie thereby, not onely the hardneſſe of our hearts, in which they ought to be imprinted; but alſo the perpetuall vſe of them, to the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galath.</hi> 3. 10.</note> very end of the world. And after, further abridged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7884:48"/> two Commandements by our Sauior Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſumme of the whole Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the firſt thing that is neceſſarily required of vs, for our better profiting by the Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That wee haue the true knowledge, and right vnderſtanding of the Law, without the which it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reape any of the former fruits. For how can a man acknowledge the breach of that Law, which he knoweth not? or how can he ſerue him in the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of performance of it, vnleſſe hee vnderſtand his Maſters will?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat rules are there to helpe vs, to the right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There be chiefly foure; whereof the firſt is, that the Law is ſpirituall, reaching to the ſoule, and all the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37. <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 27.</note> powers thereof: For the Law chargeth the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to know euery duty, euen all the will of God contained in it. It chargeth the iudgement to diſcerne betweene good and euill; betweene two good things, which is the better. It chargeth the memorie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; it chargeth the will to chuſe the better, and leaue the worſe; it chargeth the affections to loue things to be beloued, and to hate things to be hated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth the Law require theſe alike of all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, but according to the ſexe, growth in age, difference of calling: as more of a man, then of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; of a young man, then of a child; of a publike perſon, then of a priuate man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the ſecond rule?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the Law is perfect, not onely charging the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7.</note> ſoule, but alſo the whole ſoule: not onely to know, diſcerne, retaine, will, and follow good, but to doe the ſame perfectly. So in condemning euill, it condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7884:49"/> all euill; and in commanding good, it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the third rule?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When the Law forbiddeth or commandeth any thing, it forbiddeth and commandeth all meanes, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 27. 30.</note> occaſions, and prouocations thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the fourth rule?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whatſoeuer the Law commands, it forbids the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 21. 23. 24. 25.</note> contrary; and whatſoeuer it forbids, it commandeth the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is euery Commandement ſet forth vnto vs, by the ſecond perſon of the ſingular number?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God therein wiſely preuenteth a common abuſe amongſt men, which is to eſteeme that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to all men, to be (as it were) ſpoken vnto none. As you ſhall haue it common amongſt men to ſay and confeſſe, that God is iuſt and mercifull, and that hee commandeth this, and forbiddeth that; and yet they vſually ſo behaue themſelues, as though it nothing concerned them, &amp; that they notwithſtanding might liue as they liſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What learne you from this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That euery particular man is to iudge and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme that God ſpeaketh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law, to him in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, &amp; that he is accordingly to be affected therwith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why are all the Commandements (except two) ſet downe negatiuely?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Negatiue bindeth more ſtrongly: for the Negatiue precept bindeth alwaies, and to all moments of time; the Affirmatiue bindeth alwaies, but not to all moments of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> To come then vnto the words of the Law, how are they diuided?</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:7884:49"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Into a Preface, and ten Precepts or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the Preface?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage:</hi> which hath a reference to all the ten Commandements, and is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to vrge the obſeruance of euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus: If I be the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, thou muſt then keepe all my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; but I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt; therefore thou muſt keepe all my Commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can this belong vnto vs which are not Iſrael?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though we bee not Iſrael in name, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, yet we are the true Iſrael of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit and promiſe: God alſo by this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 4-10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 13. 13.</note> ſtile doth cleerely diſtinguiſh himſelfe from all Idols whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth the Lord make choyce of that benefit, which ſeemeth nothing at all to belong vnto vs, rather then of any other, wherein we communicate with them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it is the manner of God, to allure the Iſraelites, to whom the Law was giuen at the firſt, as children, with temporall benefits, hauing reſpect to their infirmity and childhood: wheras we are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of God with greater knowledge; and therefore in reſpect of them, are (as it were) at mans eſtate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it was fitteſt to expreſſe the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall deliuerie from Satan, by Chriſt, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (after a ſort) repreſented; and ſo it belongeth no leſſe (if not more) to vs then to them. And thirdly, we hauing been freed from the ſlauerie of our bloody e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, whereunto we were ſo neere more then once,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7884:50"/> and vnto whom we iuſtly haue deſerued to haue been inthralled; and it being the common caſe of all Gods children, to be in continuall danger of the like, and to feele the like goodneſſe of God towards them, wee may alſo make vſe of this title, and eſteeme it a bond alſo for vs vnto God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe it was the lateſt benefit, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereof was yet (as it were) in their mouth. And herein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord had a reſpect vnto our corrupt nature, who are ready to forget old benefits, how great ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> So much of the Preface: How are the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments diuided?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> It ſheweth, that the inward and outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God ought to goe together: ſo that they who dare preſent their bodies to a Maſſe, or any other groſſe Idolatrie, and ſay they keepe their harts to God, are here conuicted of falſhood and hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat are the particulars forbidden in the outward worſhip of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, we are forbidden to make Images; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to bow vnto them, or worſhip them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is this part ſo largely ſet forth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To meet with the corruption of men, that by nature are exceeding prone to Idolatrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are all Images by this Commandement vnlawfull?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, but ſuch as are made for religious ends and vſes: for in ciuill matters they may haue a lawfull and commendable vſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What gather you of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the Popiſh doctrine of Images (that they are Lay mens books), is directly contrary to the word
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7884:53"/> of God; and therefore to be deteſted of all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Images are moſt of all condemned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Images of God: for it is a great ſinne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or imagine in our hearts, that he is like any thing, how excellent ſoeuer we doe thinke it; but it is much worſe ſo to ſet him out to the view of others, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the mind can conceiue a further beautie, then the hand of the Artificer can expreſſe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children of Iſrael did ſin grienouſly, and were <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the Iſraelites worſhip the Calfe as God, as the Papists ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: but they worſhipped God in the Calfe: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 5.</note> for they ſaid, Let vs make a feaſt to morrow to the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein did they ſinne ſo grieuouſly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In tying the preſence of God to the worke of their owne hands, and coupling him with their Idols, <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How appeareth it, that we ſhould make no Image of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the 4. of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> the Lord forewarned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12.</note> the Iſraelites, that becauſe they ſaw no Image of him when he gaue the Law; therefore they ſhould make no likeneſſe of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But what moues the Papists to paint God like an old man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The falſe expounding of a place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other Inuentions of men (beſides Images) are here forbidden?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All ſuch inuentions of men, as are deuiſed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worſhip or ſeruice of God: likewiſe all repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any grace of God, otherwiſe then God hath appointed, or may be allowed by his word.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A threatning, to reſtraine from diſobedience, and a promiſe to allure to obedience.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That hee will puniſh the offender, both in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and children, to many generations; the greatnes of which puniſhment hee ſhewes, by comparing his wrath to the rage of a iealous husband, vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt behauiour of his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Declare the ſame more plainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If any (being ioyned vnto God in Chriſt) haue promiſed in Baptiſme to ſerue him alone; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding wil ſerue and worſhip others, how good ſoeuer they (be whether Angels, or Saints), they ſhall not eſcape Gods wrath: for if corporall adultery bee ſo ſeuerely puniſhed, much more ſhall ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But how doth that agree with the righteouſneſſe of God, to puniſh one for another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very well: for if Princes (whoſe iudgments are ſhallow in compariſon of Gods, the depthes whereof are paſt finding out) doe with equitie diſ-inherit and put to ſhame the poſterity of Traitors: the Lord may much more iuſtly doe the like. For the wicked child following his fathers ſteps, is a Traitor himſelfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing both his fathers ſinne, and his owne vpon his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why will God be ſo extreamely reuenged of them?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By a diligent preparation, before wee ſpeake of any of theſe holy things, by conſidering both of the cauſe that ſhould moue vs to ſpeake of them, and of the reuerent manner of vſing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What doth God require in this Commandement more ſpecially?</p>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 37.</note> for then by the example of Chriſt, we ought to forbeare an oath. Secondly, whether hee (for whoſe <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the things forbidden in this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>

And therefore for reſtraining of this corruption, we ſhould ſeriouſly thinke how powerfull God is, to puniſh ſuch vnreuerent behauiour; as alſo how able and ready to bleſſe them, who ſhall reuerently behaue themſelues in their tongues and words, touching theſe matters: for which cauſe wee are to remember, that the Name <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is more ſpecially forbidden?</p>

               <p>Secondly, here is forbidden the abuſe of Vowes: as the making of all vnlawfull Vowes; the not paying, or

               <p>Secondly, for that a whole day is needfull, for the performance of all the parts of Gods worſhip; as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of publike Prayer, and the Word preached, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing, adminiſtration of the Sacraments, exerciſe of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7884:59"/> holy Diſcipline, &amp; conſideration of the glory of God in the creatures. Thirdly, If <hi>Adam</hi> in his perfection had need of this helpe, much more haue we, who are ſo grieuouſly corrupted.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there any one ſpeciall day of the weeke, ſet apart by God himſelfe?</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What day is that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The firſt day in the week, called the Lords day. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7.</note>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVas this day ſet apart thereunto from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for from the firſt Creation, till the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, the laſt day of the weeke, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Saturday, was the day that was appointed thereunto; and that which the people of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obſerued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And why ſo?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By Diuine Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth that appeare?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, by the <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 10.</note> of the ſpeciall dedication thereof to the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. For otherwiſe all the daies of the weeke are the Lords daies, and hee is to bee ſerued and worſhipped in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the cauſe why the day was changed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe it might ſerue for a thankfull memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7884:60"/> of Chriſts Reſurrection: for as God reſted from his labour on the laſt day of the weeke; ſo Chriſt cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2 1. 2.</note> from his labour and Afflictions on this day: as the one therefore was ſpecially ſanctified in regard of the Creation of the world; ſo was the other, in reſpect of the reſtauration and Redemption thereof, which is a greater worke then the Creation it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Cannot this day then be altered?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, not by the power of any creature in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But doth not this Commandement directly require the ſeuenth day from the Creation?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, not neceſſarily: for it doth not thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that we ſhould reſt the ſame day the Lord reſted, but that wee ſhould reſt from our workes the ſeuenth day, as he reſted from his: which ſeuenth, as vnder the Law hee appointed to bee Saturday; ſo nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, but that by his ſpeciall appointment, vnder the Goſpell, it may bee Sunday, and yet the ſubſtance of the Commandement nothing altered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth not the New Teſtament ſpecially mention this change?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe there was no queſtion moued about the ſame, in the Apoſtles times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is not this Commandement Ceremoniall?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: Firſt, if it were ſo, then the Morall Law ſhould conſiſt but of nine words, or Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13.</note> contrarie to Gods word. Secondly, this Commandement (amongſt the reſt) <note n="b" place="margin">

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3.</note> it was before any ſhadow or Ceremony of the Law, yea, before Chriſt was promiſed, whom all Ceremonies of the Law haue reſpect vnto.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That followeth not: for the ceremoniall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of our Eternall Reſt, came after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Reſt, and therfore is acceſſorie and accidentall; for which cauſe <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Haue you yet any further reaſon, to confirme the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie of the Reſt of the ſeuenth day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Our Sauiour Chriſt willing his followers, which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20.</note> ſhould liue about 40. yeeres after his aſcenſion, to pray that their flight might not be vpon the Sabbath, to the end that they might not be hindred in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God; doth thereby ſufficiently declare, that he held not this Commandement in the account of a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When doth this our Sabbath begin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At the dawning of the day, for Chriſt roſe in the dawning thereof; whereby is put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Iewiſh, and the true Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: for as the Iewiſh Sabbath began in that part of the day, in which the Creation of the world was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and conſequently in the euening; ſo the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7884:61"/> of the memorie of Chriſts Reſurrection, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of his Reſt from his ſpecial labors, being the ground of the change of that day into this; it alſo (by the ſame proportion of reaſon) is to begin, when the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction began, which was in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Can you ſhew this by example?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> being at Troas, after hee had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7-10.</note> a whole day vntill midnight, celebrated the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord the ſame night, which was a Sabbath daies exerciſe; and therefore that night following the day, was a part of the Sabbath: for in the morning he departed, hauing ſtayed there ſeuen daies; by which it is euident, that that which was done, was vpon the Lords day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is the Lords day only to be ſeparated to Gods ſeruice?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for of this nature alſo are <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is the Commandement ſet forth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt in a ſhort ſumme, and after declared by parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the ſhort ſumme?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is to be obſerued in the word, <hi>Remember?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That although all the Commandements are needfull diligently to be remembred, yet this more ſpecially.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, becauſe this Commandement hath leaſt light of nature, to direct vs to the obſeruation of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that we are naturally moſt negligent in the obſeruation of this, ſuffering our ſelues to bee
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7884:61"/> withdrawne by our worldly buſineſſe, from Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vpon the Lords day; and therfore ſuch a ſpeciall warning is needfull to be added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is it that wee ſhould heere remember, for the better ſanctifying of the Sabbath?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we ſo compaſſe all our buſineſſe within the ſixe working daies, that our worldly affaires enter not, or incroch into the poſſeſſion of the Lords day; not onely willingly, but not ſo much as by any forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: as when (through want of foreſight, or fore-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting) the payment of money, due by obligation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch buſineſſes that might bee preuented, ſhall fall out on that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the parts of the Commandement?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are two: the firſt ſheweth what works we are to decline vpon this day; the other, what duties we are to performe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the workes that we muſt decline, and leaue vndone on the Lords day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not onely the works of ſinne, which we ought <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it vnlawfull to do any bodily worke, or worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe on the Lords day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, excepting thoſe workes which belong to <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are we as ſtrictly bound to forbeare all worldly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7884:62"/> vpon this day, as the Iewes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily, ſo far as the Commandement reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and more then they, becauſe of the greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gods graces vpon vs, aboue that which was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What doe you ſay to the making of a fire, and dreſsing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 23.</note> of meate vpon the Lords day? for neither of theſe were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Iewes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not to make a fire, or dreſſe meate on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, were proper to the Pedagogie, or manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the children vnder the Law; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by this, that there was no ſuch thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, before the Law was giuen by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth that this was Ceremoniall, and not Morall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is there ſo particular a rehearſall of the Perſons, in this Commandement are forbidden to worke?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To take away all excuſes from all perſons: for the Lord did ſee that ſuch was the corruption of men, that if they themſelues did reſt vpon this day from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they would thinke it ſufficient, not caring how they toyled out, and wearied their ſeruants at home, with continuall labour, as many doe; ſo that it were better to bee ſuch mens oxen, then their ſeruants, ſo ſmall care they haue of their ſoules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the ſpeciall vſe of this rehearſall?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To teach vs, that all ſorts and degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are bound to yeeld a duty vnto God in ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not this ordained to this end, that beaſts might ſometime reſt, and that ſeruants (eſpecially) might haue ſome time for honeſt recreation, without which they could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe continue.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:7884:62"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Some thinke ſo, but there is little or no ground for ſuch an opinion: for the wearying and toyling out of ſeruants, and beaſts, is againſt the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. And worke is here forbidden, that men might be the more free for the worſhip of God; and therefore though ſeruants had neuer ſo much reſt and recreation vpon other daies, yet they ought to reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this day in that regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth hee then make mention of the Rest of the Beaſts in this Commandement?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe Beaſts cannot bee trauelled, or vſed in any worke vpon that day, vnleſſe man be withdrawne from Gods ſeruice: yea, though the beaſt could labour without mans attendance, yet his minde would ſome way or other, be ſo carried away, and diſtracted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that it would not bee ſo fit as it ought to bee, for Gods ſeruice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But to whom ſpecially is the charge of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement directed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To Houſe-holders, and Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the charge of the Houſ-holder?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That not onely himſelfe keepe the Lords day, but his wife, children, and ſeruants, as much as may be; for as they ſerue him in the weeke, ſo muſt hee ſee that they ſerue God on the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What gather you of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That a Houſholder ſhould at leaſt bee as carefull of the Lords buſines as of his owne: and if he will not keepe ſuch a ſeruant as is not faithfull in his ordinarie worke: much leſſe ſhould he keepe any that will not be carefull in the Lords worke, how skilfull ſoeuer hee be in his owne.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That all exerciſes which ſerue not in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to make vs more fit to the Lords worke, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull vpon the Lords day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat difference doe you make betweene Sabbath nights, and other nights?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Great: for wee ſhould lay our ſelues downe to reſt in greater quietneſſe that night, vpon the ſenſe and feeling of the comforts of the former exerciſes: So that our ſleepe ſhould bee the more quiet, by how much the former exerciſes of the day haue been more holy; otherwiſe we ſhould declare wee haue not kept a day to the Lord, ſo holy as we ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> So much of the Commandement. VVhat are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to inforce the Commandement?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The firſt is, a ſecret reaſon of compariſon of the leſſe: that for ſo much as God hath giuen vs ſix daies of ſeuen to do our owne buſineſſe in (whether it bee labour, or honeſt Recreation), when hee might haue giuen vs but one of ſeuen, and haue taken ſixe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7884:64"/> wee ought not to thinke it much, to ſpend the whole ſeuenth day in his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat learne you from thence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The inequall and wretched dealing of moſt men with God: who (by the grant of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement) vrge vſually at their ſeruants hands, the work of a whole day, in euery of the ſixe daies; yet vpon the Lords day, thinke it enough both for themſelues, and thoſe vnder them, to meaſure out vnto the Lord three or foure houres onely to his ſeruice; vſing one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to mete the ſeruice due vnto themſelues, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mete the ſeruice due vnto God; which is a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 11. 1.</note> thing abominable before God; &amp; ſo much the more as the things are greater, and of more value, which they mete with the leſſer meaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the other reaſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A reaſon expreſſed, taken from the example of God: that as God hauing made all things in the ſixe daies, reſted the ſeuenth from creating any more: ſo ſhould we reſt from all our owne workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did the Lord ceaſe from all worke, on the ſeuenth day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No verily: he did then, and ſtill continueth to do a great work, in preſeruing the things created. And ſo muſt we learne not to bee idle vpon the Lords day, but to attend vpon the Lords ſeruice; and by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample wee may ſaue things on that day, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would bee loſt, but wee may not get or gaine more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is meant by ſanctifying it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſetting it apart from worldly buſineſſe, to the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat by bleſsing?</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:7884:64"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not that this day in it ſelfe, is more bleſſed then other daies, but that, in ſetting it apart and ſeparating it by this Commandement from other daies, to bee kept holy by publike exerciſes of his holy worſhip and ſeruice, he made it an effectuall meanes of bleſſing to them, that ſhall ſanctifie it as they ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVherein ſhall they be bleſſed, that keepe the Sabbath day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, in an encreaſe both of the knowledge and feare of God, and all other ſpirituall and heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accompanying ſaluation. Secondly, in matters of this life, we ſhall not onely not be hindred by keeping the Sabbath, but more bleſſed then if wee did worke that day: as of the other ſide, the gaine on the Lords day, ſhall (by the curſe of God) melt and vaniſh away, what ſhew of profit ſoeuer it haue; and bring ſome curſe or other vpon our labours in the weeke daies, which in themſelues are lawfull and honeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much of the first Table, concerning our duties to God, the due performance whereof is called</hi> Piety, <hi>wherein God (as a King or father of a houſhold) doth teach his ſubiects, or familie, their duties towards himſelfe.

               <p>

               <p>Secondly, that out of our loue to our neighbour, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 15.</note> we draw all our duties to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen to the wicked (ſo farre forth as we hinder not Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor ſome great duty to other), but eſpecially to the houſhold of faith: for ſomtime it may ſo fall out, that that which men require, (and that otherwiſe of right) may not bee giuen: as <hi>Rahab,</hi> though ſubiect to the King of Iericho, might not reueale the Spies, but ſhould haue failed in her duty, if ſhee had betrayed them at the Kings commandement; and therefore in this caſe ſhe did well, in preferring the obedience ſhee owed to God, before the dutie ſhee owed to man.

                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 1. 2.</note> promiſe, it being the firſt in order of the ſecond Table, and the onely Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of that Table that hath an expreſſe promiſe; and the onely Commandement of the ten, that hath a particular promiſe.

               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> The godly liue ſo long as it ſhall ſerue for Gods glory, and for their owne good: but the wicked liue to their further condemnation. And herein God doth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 20.</note> not a whit breake his promiſe; for if he promiſe a man ſiluer, and pay him with gold, and that in greater weight and quantity, he doth him no iniurie, and the wicked gaine nothing by their long life, receiuing (by meanes thereof) greater iudgement in hell.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It furthereth vs in the twofold vſe of the Law, before ſpoken of: for firſt, it will be a meanes the more to humble vs, and ſo the more effectually to driue vs to Chriſt: becauſe when all our ſinnes are gathered and muſtered into one troope or heape, they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7884:87"/> the greater, and caſt vs downe the more: as a man owing ſundrie debts vnto diuers, or vnto one man, in the particulars, is confident of his ability, to pay all, as long as he heareth they are all but ſmal ſums; but hearing the whole ſumme, deſpaireth of the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Secondly, it helpes vs much in our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law: for by this (as by a glaſſe) wee may the eaſier ſee, and being ſhortly contriued, we may the better remember our whole dutie both to God and man; this being (as a Card or Map of a Countrey) eaſily carried about with vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is it to loue the Lord with all our heart, and all our mind, and all our ſtrength?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A,</hi> When the whole man yeeldeth ſimple obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto him, in all the powers both of ſoule and body. As when the vnderſtanding doth perfectly comprehend all things, that God would haue vs to know; when in iudgement we thinke aright of them; when the memorie accordingly retaineth them; when in our wils and affections we perfectly loue al knowne good, and perfectly hate all knowne euill; and when all the members, parts and graces of the body, as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtrength, &amp;c. are wholly employed in the ſeruice of God, and in the doing of his will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is it to loue our neighbour as our ſelues?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When that which we would that men ſhould <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not poſsible for a man to doe all this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for wee are ignorant of many things, and thoſe which we know, we know but in part; and that which we know, we iudge not aright of, nor remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as wee ought. And as for will and affections, they are a great deale ſhorter then our knowledge. And
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7884:88"/> the wandring of our eyes in the hearing of the Word, and other parts of Gods ſeruice, doth eaſily bewray the ſmall obedience and conformity of the reſt of the members and parts of the body. To conclude, if wee doe but examine our ſoules, how wee ſtand affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to our enemies, to ſtrangers, to common men, to them wee know, yea to our deareſt friends; we ſhall finde, that we herein come ſhort of any ſuch affection to our neighbour; which as it is ſo much leſſe then the former, by how much man is inferiour to God; ſo wee being not able to accompliſh it, are much leſſe able to accompliſh the other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the righteouſneſſe of the Papiſt, is a rotten righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and ſuch as will neuer ſtand before the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Seeing then that the whole ſumme, and maine end of the Law is Loue: what gather you thereof? <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4. 5.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is the loue of God called the firſt and greatest Commandement?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe wee ſhould chiefly and in the firſt place, regard our duties to God, and be moſt carefull <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 20.</note> to vnderſtand his will, and to worſhip him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is the ſecond Table ſaid to be like vnto the firſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For that they go ſo hand in hand together, that no man can performe the one, vnleſſe hee accompliſh the other; which the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> plainly teacheth, 1. Ioh. 15. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is to bee ſaid of thoſe that ſeeme to keepe the one, and care not for the other?</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:7884:88"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> If they ſeeme to ſerue God, and are not in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are meere hypocrites: and if they will ſeeme to deale vprightly with their neighbour, and haue not the loue of God in them, they are prophane politicks, and very Atheiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Hitherto of the Couenant of workes: what is the maine vſe of all the doctrine hereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To ſhew that wee cannot thereby attaine vnto Reconciliation with God, and life euerlaſting, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our corruption, and the infirmity of our fleſh, Rom. 8. 3. For we hauing on our part broke this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, God cannot (without iniuſtice) iuſtifie vs by this Couenant; and conſequently wee cannot bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But why then is it called a Couenant, ſeeing it is in the nature of a Couenant, to reconcile thoſe that are at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; as is to be ſeene in the example of Abraham, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech: Laban, and Iacob, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>and</hi> 31. 44.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Although it bee not able to reconcile vs, yet it maketh way to reconciliation by another Couenant. Neither is it meet ſtrictly to bind Gods couenant with men, to the ſame lawes that the couenants of one man with another are bound vnto: for amongſt men, the weaker ſeeketh reconciliation at the hands of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 31. 32. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</note> mightier. But God (who neither can be hurt or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by vs) ſeeketh vnto vs for peace.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Hee was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, in the wombe of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and was afterward borne and brought forth into the world, after the manner of other men.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for hee is called the ſeed of the woman, Gen. 3. 15. He is ſaid to be made of the ſeed of <hi>Dauid,</hi> according to the fleſh. Rom. 1. 3. To bee made of a woman. Galath. 4. 4. To be a plant that ſprang out of the root of <hi>Ieſſe.</hi> Eſa. 11. 1. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is he ſaid to be conceiued by the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the holy Ghoſt (by his incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Q.</hi> But is he not therefore called the Sonne of the higheſt, Luk. 1. 32. becauſe he was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> No: but onely becauſe hee that was ſo concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth the humane nature of Chriſt conſiſt of a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule, as well as a body: or was the God-head in ſtead of the ſoule vnto him.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Thus much of the two natures of our Sauiour Chriſt: what is to be ſaid concerning the vnion of theſe two natures?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The manhood of our Sauiour Chriſt, is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie vnited to the perſon of the God-head, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſubſiſteth, making but one perſon; which neare vnion with the nature of man, is ſo much the more wonderfull, in that the very Angels, (which are much greater in glory then men) are <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. 2.</note> not able to abide the preſence of God. And indeed it is ſuch <note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</note> a myſterie, as neither Angels, or men, are able to comprehend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then Chriſt, though he conſiſt of two natures, is but one perſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is truth, he is true God, and true man, in one and the ſame perſon of the Deitie. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Galath.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the inſeparable vnion of the Humane nature to the perſon of the Deitie, change the perſon thereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No verily; but hee is the very ſame perſon that he was, from all eternitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not ſaid in the text, that the WORD, (.i. the ſecond perſon in Trinity) <hi>was made fleſh?</hi> may it not ſeeme then that the God-head was turned into the Humane nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nothing leſſe; no more then it can be ſaid, hee
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7884:92"/> was turned into ſinne, or into a curſe, becauſe it is ſaid, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Galath.</hi> 3.</note> he was made ſinne, or made a curſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Can you proue directly by the Scriptures, that Christ, after the vnion of the man-hood with the God-head, is true God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea verily: for firſt, the Scripture, (as hee is Chriſt the Meſſias) abſolutely calleth him God, and giueth vnto him the name of <hi>Iehouah.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. 2. Secondly, the proper workes of God are attributed vnto him; as the creation and gouernment of the world. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 2. 3. The ſearching of harts. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Eſſentiall Attributes of the Diuine nature are giuen to him, he is ſaid to be eternall. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Micah.</hi> 5. 2. Almighty, in all places, the King of Kings, &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 31. <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 19. 16. Fourthly, the Scriptures aſſigne Diuine honour vnto him. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 72. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 12. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 59.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But is not the God-head, and man-hood at leaſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and confounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, by no meanes. For then he ſhould bee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, nor man; for things mingled doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the name of their ſimples; as honey, and oyle mixed together, can neither be called honey nor oyle. Further, the properties of the two natures are ſuch, as cannot be mingled and confounded. For neither can the Humane nature, (remaining a true humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) partake, or communicate of the properties and perfections of the Deitie, or the Deitie of the defects of the Humanitie. So that as the God-head cannot hunger, thirſt, or be ſhut vp and circumſcribed within the bounds of a place: no more can the Humanity be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7884:92"/> infinite, or in more places then one. So that though the humane nature be no perſon of it ſelfe, and hath no ſubſiſtance, but in the perſon of the Deitie, yet it continueth ſtill diſtinct in ſubſtance, properties, and actions, from the Deitie; and both natures ſo vnited, make but one Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why was it neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould bee both God and man in one perſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was neceſſarie he ſhould be man, becauſe he could not ſuffer as hee was God; <note n="a" place="margin">

Secondly, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie he ſhould be God alſo, that he might bee able to beare and ouercome all that was to be inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for our ſinnes. Thirdly, it was neceſſarie alſo that the humane nature ſhould (in manner aforeſaid) be vnited to the perſon of the Deitie, that the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which hee performed, might bee of infinite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as being the obedience of God. <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What further fruit haue we by this coniunction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That whereas God hath no ſhape comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, either to the eye of the body, or of the ſoule; and the mind of man cannot reſt but in a repreſentation of ſome thing, that his mind and vnderſtanding can in ſome ſort reach vnto. If it conſider God in the ſecond perſon in the Trinitie, as he hath taken our nature, and whereby God is (after a ſort) reuealed in the fleſh, he hath whereupon (in ſome ſort) to ſtay his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did then the Iewes before his comming, which could not doe ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They might propoſe to themſelues the ſecond <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 1. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 1. 2.</note> perſon, that ſhould take our nature, and the ſame alſo that had appeared ſundry times in the ſhape of a man:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7884:93"/> albeit herein our priuiledge is greater then theirs; wee beholding him as he is, whereas they did behold him as he ſhould be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Haue men onely benefit by this vnion of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or doth it reach alſo to the Angels?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It ſeemeth to reach no further then to man; for God neuer meant to ſaue thoſe angels that fell, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they fell maliciouſly into rebellion againſt God, without tentation, contrary to the cleare light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reuealed in their Creation. And if he had purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either to ſaue them, or to haue benefited the elect <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. 16.</note> Angels, any otherwiſe then by confirming them, hee would haue taken their nature vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But why then is it ſaid, that God (by Christ) doth reconcile all things vnto himſelfe, whether in earth, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By things in heauen, is there to be vnderſtood, not the Angels, but the Saints then in heauen. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God did elect the Angels to eternal glory; yet Chriſt did not redeeme them, but onely the ſeed of <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why? what hereſies hath hee raiſed vp about this point?</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7884:93"/> and that hee paſſed through the Virgin, onely as water through a pipe. Thirdly, of the <hi>Manichies,</hi> who made him to haue onely an imaginarie body. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> who denied that Chriſt had a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule; and who held, that his Diuinitie was in ſtead of a ſoule. Fifthly, of <hi>Eunomions,</hi> who affirmed that Chriſt was a meere man, and the Sonne of God onely by adoption. Sixthly, of <hi>Ebion,</hi> who held that Chriſt was borne of the ſeed of man. Seuenthly, of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who taught, that as there was two natures in Chriſt, ſo alſo there was two perſons.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea verily, as appeareth expreſſely by the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How pooue you it otherwiſe?</p>

               <p>Thirdly, this was ſhadowed by the types of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who alone was in the mountaine; and of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or the high Prieſt, who onely might enter in the holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, this is ſet forth by diuers ſimilitudes: as where he ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the way, I am the doore.</hi> Alſo hee is the <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then no man, that is a man onely can bee Mediator betweene God and man?</p>
               <p>Q. No verily: for as <hi>Ely</hi> ſaith, <hi>If one man ſin againſt another, the Iudge ſhall iudge him: but if a man ſin against the Lord, who ſhall entreat for him? viz.</hi> when one man ſhall offend againſt another, the matter may be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7884:94"/> by Iudges, which are but men: but if a man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt God, there is no meere man can make his peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is Chriſt then Mediator in reſpect of both natures?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, in reſpect of both ioyntly: firſt, becauſe though he conſiſt of two diſtinct natures, Diuine, and Humane; yet hee is God and man onely in one and the ſame perſon. Secondly, becauſe he that is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, is a prieſt, after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father, and without mother; which could not bee ſaid, if he were Mediator, either in reſpect of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature alone, or of his Humane. Thirdly, ſeeing hee is by his office to reconcile God to man, and man to God, both natures ioyntly are neceſſarie to this worke, hee hauing (by that meanes) affinity to both. Fourthly, the workes of his Mediation, being of ſuch an infinite price and value as they are with God, they muſt needs bee the workes both of God and man. Fifthly, none could ſatisfie God for the ſins of men, but God; and none ought to ſatisfie for them but man. Therefore Chriſt, that hath by his Mediation effected this, being both God and man in one perſon, is in, and according vnto both thoſe natures conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a Mediator betweene God and man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVas hee not then a Mediator before hee became man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: for though at the firſt hee had not actually taken our nature vpon him; yet with God (things to come being as if they were preſent, or paſt), he was in <note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, by vertue of his Prophetical office, he did not onely bring an outward ſound vnto the eare; but wrought (as hee did before his comming, and as hee doth now by the Miniſtery of his word), an alteration in the mind.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he continually maketh interceſſion for vs to God, and of himſelfe alone is able to ſaue vs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the father through him.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that in himſelfe he is holy. Secondly, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers harmeleſſe and innocent. Thirdly, vndefiled in himſelfe, and in regard of others: and to ſpeake in a word, he is ſeparated from ſinners. In all which, hee differeth from thoſe of <hi>Aaron;</hi> for they are neither ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in themſelues, nor innocent, neither vndefiled, but polluting, and being polluted by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the fruit we gather of this his holineſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, and vndefiledleſſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he being holy and innocent, vndefiled, and ſo conſequently ſeparate from ſinners, ſin is not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can bee attributed to the faithfull, and that theſe his properties are imputed to them by faith for theirs, for whoſe ſake and benefit hee became man, and was endued with theſe properties: and therefore he freeth them, both from originall and actuall ſinne. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine of the Papiſts, who ſay, <hi>that hee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs from originall ſinne onely, and that we muſt make ſatisfaction for actuall.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, whereas they offered firſt for themſelues, and then for the people; he offered for the people on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for for himſelfe he needed not.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, to proue the abſoluteneſſe, perfection, and excellencie of this his prieſthood. Secondly, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Prieſthood of the Papiſts, and proue it to be a falſe Prieſthood: for firſt, they are not of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> neither confirmed by an oath; and therefore not perpetuall. Secondly, they are not holy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but vnholy; neither innocent, nor vndefiled, but defiling others, and being defiled of them, and ſo not ſeparate from ſinners, but altogether ſinfull, and ſet in ſinne. Thirdly, they offer firſt for themſelues, and then for the people likewiſe many times, and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are not themſelues: and laſtly, they bring a great diſgrace to the Prieſthood of Chriſt, by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues to him: they making themſelues the Prieſts, and him the Sacrifice, whom they ſay they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, generally by compariſon, ſhewing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude betweene his Kingdome, and the regiment of worldly Potentates: that where other Kings exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute matters by their Lieuetenants and deputies, armed with their authority: in our Sauiours King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, although there bee vſed inſtruments; yet doe they accompliſh his will and purpoſe, not only by his authoritie, but alſo by his ſtrength and vertue.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That there is no miniſteriall head of the Church, which is Chriſt his Kingdome; ſith he is himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually preſent in the ſame, and that moſt notably by his ſpirit; and more to the aduantage of his Church, then when he was bodily preſent: and therefore the <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How are his properties ſet forth more particularly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that hee ſhould bee called Wonderfull; not that it ſhould be his proper name, which was only Ieſus; but that hee ſhould bee as renounedly knowne to be wonderfull, as men are knowne by their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is he Wonderfull?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Partly in his perſon, in regard of the wonderful vnion of God and man in one perſon, (as hath been ſaid); partly in his workes.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is he wonderfull in his workes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not onely in the Creation of the world, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7884:100"/> the preſeruation therof, but eſpecially in the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church; &amp; through thoſe wonders which he worketh, either in the gathering or preſeruing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: whereby he makes himſelfe knowne to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and redeemer thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the next that followeth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is ſhewed more particularly wherein hee is wonderfull: and firſt, that he is wonderfull in counſel, and therefore called the Counſellor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is here generally to be obſerued?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That whereas in the gouernment of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">

Hence in the Reuelation of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he is deſcribed thus; To be <hi>in the middeſt of the golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, clothed with agarment downe to the foot:</hi> ſuch as Counſellors vſe to weare; and that <hi>his head and haires are white as white wooll, and as ſnow:</hi> whereby is noted, ſuch a perſon, as for grauity, and great experience is fit to giue counſell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is further to be gathered hence?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Matter of great comfort for vs that are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, in that our Sauiour Chriſt is our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, who is able and willing to giue vs all ſound ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, in whatſoeuer concerneth our good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are we here further to learne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That when we are in any perplexitie, and know not which way to turne vs, we ſeeke vnto our Sauiour Chriſt for aduice and direction, who is giuen vs for a Counſellor.</p>
               <p>

               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:7884:101"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> By humble Supplications, and prayers made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How may we receiue aduice from him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the doctrine of God, drawne out of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word; and teſtimonies, which therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What followeth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That hee is wonderfull in might, <hi>and the ſtrong God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What haue we here to learne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that as hee is wiſe, to aduiſe and foreſee things pertaining to the good of his Church: ſo hee is of power to execute and effect all that hee aduiſeth, wiſely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that as there is in vs no aduice of our ſelues; ſo there is in vs no found ſtrength to keepe vs from any euill; but that as hee giueth good aduice to his, ſo doth he (by his owne power) performe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13.</note> it. And therefore although we be as the vine, of all other trees the weakeſt; or as the ſheepe, of all other beaſts the ſimpleſt: yet wee haue for our gardiner, and for our ſheepheard, Chriſt Ieſus the mightie ſtrong God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that we ſhould take heed how we depart from his obedience; for he both can, and will do what pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other property followeth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two other, which are (as it were) the branches and effects of the former: firſt, that hee is the father of Eternities: ſecondly, the Prince of peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not this title, The father of eternities; argue a confuſion of the Diuine perſons?</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:7884:101"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> In no caſe: for it is a borrowed ſpeech, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he is the author of eternitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What doe you learne from hence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That where other Kingdomes alter and come <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.</note> to an end, his is euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What doctrine is to be gathered from thence:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that the Kingdome of our Sauiour Chriſt being perpetuall, hee daſheth and cruſheth in pieces, all other Monarchies, and Regiments (how mighty ſoeuer) that riſe vp againſt him and his Kingdome; and therefore that his Church and ſubiects generally, and euery particular member, need not feare any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that whatſoeuer wee haue by nature or <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 6. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24. 25.</note> induſtrie, it is momentanie, like vnto the graſſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth away; and whatſoeuer durable thing wee haue, we haue it from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the ſecond property ariſing out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he is the Prince of peace; that is, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer, cauſe, and ground of peace, that procureth peace for his ſubiects, and cauſeth them to continue in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Of what nature is this peace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is ſpirituall: for firſt, wee haue peace with <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where is this peace eſtabliſhed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Vpon the throne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that is, in the Church of God.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Very great: for except that wee bee alſo made righteous, we cannot enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and enioy the bleſſed preſence of God: a banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt aſſoone as his debt is paid, is not by and by fit to bee made the Burgeſſe of a City, without goods; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a beggerly priſoner, aſſoone as hee is at liberty, <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, the defect of our vnderſtanding, in that the worke is not done with knowledge abſolute and throughly perfect. Secondly, the feebleneſſe of our memorie, that doth not ſo fully retaine that which the vnderſtanding conceiueth. Thirdly, the peruerſneſſe of our willes and affections, which come ſhort of their dutie. Laſt of all, the weakeneſſe and dulneſſe of our bodies, which are not ſo apt and nimble, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of good things, as is required.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are in the Inſtrumentall cauſes like to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon labourer, which being hired by the day, worketh with one hand, whereas both are required; or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a piece of the day, being hired for the whole.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that we haue not a direct eye to Gods glory, or the good of our neighbour, as is required; but looke indirectly at thoſe duties which are enioyned to vs: like to ſuch Artificers, as preferre their owne credit in their skill, before their maſters profit.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant by the word Prophecying?</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:7884:107"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, the word of God preached and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is the principall, and that which is properly and principally meant by Prophecying. Secondly, herein alſo (by a figuratiue ſpeech) is meant all other outward meanes, wherby God vſeth to giue his holy ſpirit, and by meanes whereof it ordinarily worketh; as the Sacraments, and the diſcipline of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Before we enter into this matter, there are ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to be cleared in the words of the text. And firſt tell me, why the Apoſtle hath ſet the Spirit, before the preaching of the Word, meant by prophecie; conſidering that by, and after the preaching of the Word, the Lord giueth his Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Spirit is the chiefe of the two; the word being but the inſtrument whereby the ſpirit of God worketh. And ſecondly, for that the worke of the ſpirit is more generall, and reacheth to ſome, to whom the preaching of the word cannot reach. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that the word is neuer profitable without the ſpirit: but the ſpirit may bee profitable without the word, as after will appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Another difficultie is this: It may ſeeme by theſe words, that the ſpirit of adoption and ſanctification, proper to the faithfull, may be loſt; ſeeing hee exhorteth that wee ſhould not quench the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nothing leſſe: but as God doth aſſure the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their continuance in him; ſo hee doth declare by theſe exhortations, that a ſpeciall meanes whereby <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23.</note> hee will nouriſh this holy fire in vs, is, by taking heed vnto the preaching of the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Come then to the matter: Is it not lawfull to ſeparate theſe meanes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In no caſe: for that which God hath ioyned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.</note> together, no man may ſeparate.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:7884:107"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth it appeare more euidently, that God hath ioyned theſe together?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By that which the Prophet ſaith (Eſa. 59). That he will make this couenant with his people, that his ſpirit ſhall be vpon them; and that his words which he <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 59. 21.</note> hath put into their mouth, ſhall not depart out of their mouth, nor out of the mouth of their ſeeds ſeed, for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat learne you hereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That no man is to content himſelfe, with this fancy, that he hath the ſpirit, and ſo neglect the Word, becauſe ordinarily they goe together. Yea alwaies, where God vouchſafeth to giue his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVho are by this condemned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Anabaptiſts, Papiſts, and Libertines, which aſcribe to the ſpirit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they luſt, though it haue <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat other ſort of men is here condemned?</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is Baptiſme?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is the firſt Sacrament of the Goſpell, wherein, <note place="margin">

               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:7884:116"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why call you it the firſt Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe our Sauiour Chriſt requireth of his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48.</note> Diſciples, in that commiſſion which he gaue them to teach all nations; that after they haue taught men to beleeue, they ſhould bee baptized, and thereby (as it were) be enrolled amongſt thoſe of the houſhold of God; or entred into the number of the Citizens and burgeſſes of the heauenly Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to note an abuſe of the ancient Church, who vpon an erroneous conceit, that thoſe which fell after Baptiſme, could not repent, and ſo bee ſaued, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Baptiſme till the houre of their death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to note, that it ought to be adminiſtred but once onely, at our firſt admittance into the viſible Church of Chriſt. For firſt, it is ſaid the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 42.</note> in prayer, and breaking of bread, not in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. Secondly, it is a pledge of our new birth; now as a man being borne once, hath no need to be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: ſo hee that is once baptized, needs not to bee baptized any more: and although (in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes) mention bee made of the doctrine of Baptiſmes; yet thereby is not meant that Chriſtians were then taught to be often baptized, but that they were to acknowledge and ſeeke for a double Baptiſme; the one outward of water, the other inward of the ſpirit; both which the faithfull receiue at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is it required that we be baptized into the name <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</note> of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe by Baptiſme wee are conſecrated to <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it neceſſarie that we that are baptized, ſhould bee ingrafted into Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea: for being naturally, after the fall, cut off from God, wee muſt needs bee ingrafted into him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as new plants, if we looke to liue by him euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What force hath Baptiſme in this ingrafting?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a ſeale and a pledge of it, and not that, by which the ingrafting, or incorporation it ſelfe is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; conſidering that wee are baptized, in the right onely of being members of Chriſt before.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What fruit ariſeth from this ingrafting into Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A new birth, of which alſo this Sacrament is a ſeale and pledge, and wherof we being once partakers, can neuer be depriued. Ioh. 3. 5.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doe you proue that Infants are to be baptized?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is the ſame vſe of Baptiſme vnder the Goſpell, that was of Circumciſion vnder the Law; and the Infants of Chriſtians are vnder the Couenant as well as theirs; and Baptiſme is a ſigne of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as well as Circumciſion: if therefore <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. 12.</note> Infants were circumciſed, and Baptiſme poſſeſſe the roome of Circumciſion, except there can bee ſhewed a ſpeciall prohibition or reſtraint in Gods word, it will follow that Infants alſo may be baptized. Further, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are ſaid to baptize <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16.</note> whole families, amongſt which it is ordinarie, that there be ſome children, and there is no reaſon to limit the words to them that are at yeeres. And this vſe hath continued in the Church ſince the Apoſtles times, and was neuer gainſaid by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but thoſe, that by the vniuerſal Church, haue been iudged hereticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is Baptiſme abſolutely neceſſarie to the ſaluation of Infants? or are we to iudge all thoſe damned that die vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Such a conceit is both vnchriſtian, and vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, and without all ground, offering wrong to the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7884:118"/> grace of God, and the vertue of his Couenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he promiſeth that he will be the God of the faithful and their ſeed. And ſeeing this Sacrament is not the cauſe, but a teſtimonie and ſeale onely of ſaluation; and the fault is not in the Infant, that hee is not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and ſeeing in caſes of meere neceſſity, where there is no contempt of the means, but the party doth as much for the obtaining of them as he can doe, God doth not tie himſelfe to the meanes; but can (and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth) giue the thing without the meanes: neither haue we herein more warrant, to iudge the Infants of Chriſtians damned, that (without any default of their owne) die without Baptiſme, then the Infants of the Iſraelites, that died before the eighth day, or whileſt they were in the wilderneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What preparation is to bee required of Infants that are to be baptized?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> None can be required of them, who in regard of age are but meere patients; but that which is to bee performed, is to be done of them that bring the child to Baptiſme, and that are preſent at the baptizing thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who are they?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, hee is to conſider of the goodneſſe of God, that hath receiued not onely himſelfe, but his <note place="margin">

Secondly, hee is to preſent <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 60. 63.</note> the child. Thirdly, to giue, or to take order for the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of ſome ſuch name, as may put the child in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7884:118"/> of ſome good dutie, by the ſignification of it; or by ſetting before him in it, the example of ſome, whoſe faith and vertues are commended in the Scriptures. Fourthly, after Baptiſme, when the child <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 4.</note> is capable, he is to catechize, and to bring it vp in the feare and information of the Lord, or to procure it to bee done by others that are more able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the duties of the rest of the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, to reioyce, and to giue thankes to God for the encreaſe of his Church.

Thirdly, when it commeth to age, to doe ſuch duties vnto it, as one member oweth to another.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat manner of bread is fittest?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ordinarie bread; for ſuch our Sauiour (at the firſt inſtitution) tooke, as was at that time commonly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 18. 19</note> vſed. It was indeed vnleauened bread, but no other at that time was lawfull, nor to be had in that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat doth the bread and wine ſignifie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The body and blood of Chriſt. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhy did the Lord make choyce of theſe creatures of bread and wine to this end?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe they are (of all the meanes of our nouriſhment <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 15.</note>) the chiefeſt; and therefore meaning to ſet forth our ſpirituall nouriſhment by bodily things, he made choyce of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhy did hee not content himſelfe with one of theſe onely?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That hee might thereby ſhew, that by him wee haue whatſoeuer is needfull to nouriſh vs to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and that wee haue a plentifull and aſſured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in Chriſt. Wherefore the practice of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7884:119"/> Papiſts, in taking away the cup, is anſwerable to their doctrine; who teach, that neither we are ſaued whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor certainly by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat are the ſacramentall actions about the bread and wine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Actions of the Miniſter, or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat are the Miniſters actions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, after the example of our Sauiour Chriſt, he conſecrateth the bread and wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did our Sauiour conſecrate them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, by ſeparating the bread and wine from the ordinarie vſe to this holy vſe, by prayer and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing; the latter whereof being plainly expreſſed by the Apoſtle, doth imply the former. Whereby wee may vnderſtand, that our Sauiour Chriſt prayed to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24.</note> God his heauenly Father, to this effect, that his death in it ſelfe ſufficient to ſaue, might by the working of his ſpirit, be effectuall to the elect; and that thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes of bread and wine might (through the operation of his holy ſpirit) bee effectuall to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they are ordained for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth this conſecration change the bread and wine into the body and blood of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: but they ſtill continue in nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance bread and wine ſtill, and are but only types and ſeales of Chriſts body and blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But doth not our Sauiour ſay of the bread, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and of the wine, <hi>This is my blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though he do; yet it thence no more follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the bread is his very reall body, and the wine his blood, then that he is a materiall doore, or vine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith, I am the doore, I am the vine.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:7884:120"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is our Sauiour then to be vnderſtood?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To ſpeake by an vſuall figure, where the name of the thing ſignified, is giuen to the ſigne. After the ſame manner that in the old Teſtament, Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is called the Couenant, and the Lambe, the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.</note> becauſe they were ſignes of thoſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſpeciall reaſons haue you againſt the change of theſe elements into the very body and blood of Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Tranſubſtantiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, then at the firſt inſtitution, there muſt needs be two Chriſts, one that giueth, another that is giuen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the bread bee the very body of Chriſt, &amp;c. then there is no true and proportionable ſigne to repreſent the thing ſignified, and conſequently no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſame indiuiduall body muſt then of neceſſity be in more places then one at once, which is not onely againſt the nature of a true humane body, but of a body in generall alſo.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts cal it bread and wine after the conſecration. 1. Cor. 10. 16. 26. 27. 28. Matth. 26. 29.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if there were any ſuch change, it were the greateſt miracle in the world, but all other miracles are ſuch, as haue been apparent to ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, then the wicked as well as the godly, ſhould receiue Chriſt Ieſus and his quickening ſpirit, which is neuer ſeparated from him. Yea (which is horrible to conſider) mice and rats may eate the true bodie of Chriſt, and drinke his blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But it is not likely, that at this time, and in this place, our Sauiour would vſe a figuratiue ſpeech, and ſpeak obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas he might haue ſpoken plainly?</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:7884:120"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, it is plaine, that at the ſame time he vſed as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 5.</note> figuratiue a ſpeech as this. Secondly, in this inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo wee muſt of neceſſity acknowledge, that hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a figure when hee ſaith, that <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 10.</note> the cup is the new Teſtament. Thirdly, there is often more light and plainneſſe in a figure, then in a proper ſpeech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But what may be noted out of this forme of ſpeech?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The neare and ſure coniunction of the ſigne, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.</note> with the thing ſignified, which it hath in them that ſhall receiue it worthily; in ſo much as they which partake of the one, receiue the other alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then it ſeemes, that though vpon the conſecration, the bread and wine bee not changed into the reall body and blood of Chriſt, that yet they are preſent, in, with, or vnder the bread and wine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not corporally, ſubſtantially, or locally; for then, firſt, the body of Chriſt ſhould be euery where; which doth as much deſtroy the nature of a humane body, as to be in many places at once. Secondly, then as in tranſubſtantiation, the body and blood of Chriſt ſhould not be a ſpiritual food of the ſoule, but bodily, ſuch as the wicked eate of as well as the godly. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then alſo (as in tranſubſtantiation) Chriſt ſhould be eaten as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Capernaites fancied, really, &amp; with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 26.</note> which our Sauiour denieth. Fourthly, it ſhould not then be true, which is ſaid, Act. 3. 21. That the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens ſhall containe him, till the time that all things bee reſtored. Fifthly, it is the nature of that faith by which we lay hold on, and receiue Chriſt, to ſeeke him, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloff.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 10.</note> behold him, in heauen, and to feed vpon him there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Thus much of the firſt action of the Miniſter: what other actions are there of his?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Hee taketh the bread and breaketh it, and the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7884:121"/> wine and poureth it out, deliuering them vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, and ſhewing the ſignification of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant and ſignified hereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That Chriſt himſelfe (of his owne accord) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth his body to be boken, and his blood to be ſhead for our ſinnes; and that this body ſo broken, and his blood ſo ſhead, being receiued by faith, is that food by which we liue euerlaſtingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth our Sauiour ſay, This is my body which <hi>is broken</hi> for you, when yet it was not broken?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is vſuall in the Scripture, to ſhew the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that which is to come, by ſpeaking of them, as if they were preſent. Eſa. 9. 6. Ezech. 39. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth Chriſt call the cup, the cup of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe it is a ſeale of the promiſe of God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſaluation in Chriſt; which being in old time vnder the Law, ſhadowed by the ſheading of the blood of beaſts, is now vnder the Goſpell, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the blood-ſheading of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the ſacramentall actions of them which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To take the bread, and to eate it; and the wine, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. 27.</note> and to drinke it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is ſignified thereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The applying of Chriſt crucified and all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, vnto our ſelues by faith, as the onely meanes by which we looke to liue eternally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the fitteſt time for the celebration of this Sacrament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Lords day in the morning. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But our Sauiour celebrated it vpon another day, &amp; both he and his Apoſtles, at another time, euen in the night?</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:7884:121"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, our Sauiour did this occaſionally after ſupper, in regard of the Paſſeouer, in the roome wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this was to ſucceed; and therefore hee did inſtitute it preſently after the eating of it. Secondly, that it might goe immediately before his paſſion, the better to ſhew whereunto it hath relation. Thirdly, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did it in the night, vpon neceſſity, for feare of perſecution; and therfore where there is no ſuch cauſe of feare, the cuſtome of our owne Churches is to bee performed, which celebrate it in the morning, when our wits, memories and capacities are moſt freſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But is there no ſpeciall matter to bee obſerued, that our Sauiour celebrated this Sacrament after ſupper?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily: for thereby we learne, that wee are not to come to this table to fill our bellies; but wee are to haue our mindes lifted vp from theſe earthly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to our Sauiour Chriſt, repreſented by them. For it is not the vſe after ſupper to ſet bread and wine vpon the table, but banqueting diſhes: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues them which come only for a draught of wine, and ſuch as reſt onely in the receit of the outward elements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How oft are the Sacraments to be celebrated?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As oft in a yeere, as the Church where wee are members may conueniently (and agreeable to the dignitie of the myſterie) communicate therein. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What perſons haue title to this Sacrament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All Chriſtians, that are of yeeres of diſcretion, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. 28.</note> and haue been baptized, being fitted thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May not infants and children partake thereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, becauſe they cannot performe that dutie which the Apoſtle requireth of all worthie receiuers; <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.</note> that is, they cannot trie and examine themſelues.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:7884:122"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By what meanes may we be fit receiuers of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, by a careful preparation before the action, great heed in the action, and a ioyfull and thankfull cloſe and ſhutting vp of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How are we to prepare our ſelues before the action?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Wee are, firſt, to examine our knowledge, as in the grounds and principles of religion; ſo alſo in this Sacrament, whether we vnderſtand the meaning and vſe thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſignification of the ſignes, and the graces that they ſeale.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee are to examine what faith wee haue, and what repentance; not onely in the generall, but for our particular ſinnes; whether wee doe bewaile them, or iudge our ſelues for them, otherwiſe we ſhall ſtirre vp Gods wrath againſt vs, and thoſe that belong <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. 31</note> vnto vs, and moue him (although not to condemne vs in the world to come) yet to inflict fearfull plagues and iudgements vpon vs in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What heed is to be taken in the action?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That in the act of receiuing, with the ſignes we conſider and call to our remembrance the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar matters ſignified. Seeing the bread broken, and the wine poured out, wee are affectionately to remember the body of Chriſt broken, and his blood ſhead for vs; and by the eye of faith, behold him crucified (as it were) before our eyes. Further, beholding the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reaching forth theſe elements vnto vs, wee are to behold Chriſt himſelfe therein, offering himſelfe, and all his merits vnto vs, if we will receiue them by faith. Laſtly, in the ſtretching forth of our hands to receiue theſe elements, wee are to labour to haue a ſenſe and feeling of our faith, laying hold vpon Chriſt and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7884:122"/> all his ſauing benefits: and in our eating of this bread, and drinking this wine, wee are to labour to feele ſuch a ſpirituall refreſhing of our ſoules, with the body and blood of Chriſt, as wee feele in our bodies by the bread and wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How are we to cloſe and ſhut vp this action?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are to be comforted in heart, in the ſenſe of Gods fauour towards vs: from whence we ſhould be ready (with feeling ioy) to ſing a Pſalm vnto the Lord, of praiſe and thankſ-giuing: and feeling our ſelues ſtrengthened in the new man, we are to depart with a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 30.</note> reſolution to walke more ſtrongly, and ſteadily in the waies of God, all the daies of our life afterward. For this is a Sacrament, not of our incorporation into Chriſt, but of our growth in him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very much, both to helpe the godly, and to reſtraine and root out the wicked out of the Church; euen as much as of the ſword of the Magiſtrate in the Common-wealth, or the rod in the houſe; yea, ſo much more, as theſe are for the body, and this life, the other for the ſoule, and the life to come.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are ſuch as ſerue to bring men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and are either priuate or publike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Speake firſt of priuate Cenſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They conſiſt in ſuch admonitions, as are to bee giuen to brethren that haue offended, whereof there are ſundry degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which is the firſt degree of admonition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If thy brother offend againſt thee, or in thy knowledge, firſt tell him thereof, and that onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and him.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are wee bound to reproue all men, of what profeſſion ſoeuer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, but him that is of the ſame profeſſion of Chriſtianity that we be, whom the Scripture tearmeth a brother; thereby ſhutting forth Turkes, Iewes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Atheiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What learne you thereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we are not to contemne or make light of the admonitions of our brethren, but to account of them as of precious balme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How muſt we reproue our brothers fault?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Wee muſt conuince him by the word of God, of that fault we reproue, ſo as hee ſhall not bee able to gaine-ſay the ſame without ſhew of obſtinacie and contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What may be gathered hereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That vnleſſe we reproue him, wee are partakers of his ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What further?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it muſt be done in loue, not of hatred; or to reproch him, as one that is glad of ſomthing to hurt his good name.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:7884:124"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is meant by</hi> tell him betweene thee and him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That wee ſhould haue a ſpeciall regard to the good name and report of another man; if his fault be priuate, wee are not to ſpread it abroad: as ſome that thinke they be burthened, vnleſſe they tell it to others; which is not according to the rule of charity.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is this added,</hi> If thy brother heare thee, thou haſt gained thy brother?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As a notable meanes of encouraging vs in this dutie, whereby we may be a meanes of ſauing a ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What if I gaine not my brother?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Notwithſtanding thou looſeſt not thy labour; for God will recompence it plentifully, and lay it vp amongſt the reſt of thy good deeds: alſo it ſhal ſerue to further his iudgement, for refuſing ſuch profitable meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which is the ſecond degree of admonition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is priuate, although leſſe priuate then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for if thy brother heare thee not, thou muſt yet take with thee one or two: for although he heare not the firſt admonition, yet loue will not giue him ouer, but as the caſe requireth, and as the nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the offender may be diſcerned to bee eaſie, or hard to relent, thou muſt take one, or (if need be) two at the moſt to ioyne with thee in this dutie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What choyce is to be made for the ſecond admonition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not this enemie, or one that is not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince; but one or two ſuch are to bee choſen, as are likeſt to take effect, and fitteſt both for their gifts and authority to recouer him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May the firſt admoniſher ſubſtitute another in his place the ſecond time?</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:7884:124"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for our Sauiour Chriſt doth not leaue it free ſo to doe, but will haue him that did firſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, to bee one; as it may ſeeme, both for the better confirming of the former dealing with the latter, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the keeping of the fault of the offender in as much ſecrecie as may be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is gathered hereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The great loue and care of our Sauiour Chriſt, towards poore ſinners: as alſo what diligence wee muſt vſe, and what care for our brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why may not one alone deale with him, the ſecond time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe by the teſtimonie of two or three, hee might be brought to reuerence that counſell, that hee would not regard at the firſt admonition; and further, that, way may bee made to the publike iudgement of the Church: for otherwiſe there would bee but the one mans yea, and the others nay, before the Church, which vnder two teſtimonies (at leaſt) cannot proceed further againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And thus far of priuate Cenſures, the publike follow: what is that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Excommunication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is Excommunication?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The caſting of an obſtinate offender out of the Church, accounting of him, as the Iewes did of an Heathen, excluding him from the prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, &amp; as of a Publican, with whom they would neither eate nor drinke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How are they to proceed in this cenſure?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If he will not harken to the priuate admonitions aforeſaid, the Church is to be told.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is here meant by the Church principally?</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:7884:125"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Gouernours of the Church, who are as the mouth of the Church. Where againe appeares the ſingular loue and mercy of God towards his children; for as when the Kings ſonne is very ſicke, there vſeth to be aſſembled the whole Colledge of Phyſitians, for his recouerie: ſo alſo for the healing of the ſonnes &amp; daughters of the great King, he gathereth (as it were) a colledge of wiſe and diſcreet men to heale them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What if he heare not the Church, muſt hee preſently be caſt out?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for as a good Phyſitian, or Chirurgion, before he cut, burne, or ſeare, will vſe all other meanes; ſo, good and wiſe Gouernours of the Church, will pauſe ſome conuenient time, vſing prayer and faſting, to finde (if it may be) fauour with God, that hee may repent, before the fearfull Cenſure of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and cutting off, bee executed againſt the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But if he haue been admoniſhed, and admoniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; if hee haue been ſuſpended from the Sacrament, and the Church haue been long patient, if no remedie bee left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, what are the Gouernours of the Church to doe then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are to proceed to the excommunication aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Ought he not to be dealt with afterward for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, and may we not buy and ſell with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; the Miniſters of the Word muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to conuert him; neither can the Church forbid him to occupie his trade, for it is a ciuill thing: and therefore the Pope, by diſcharging ſubiects from their alleageance to their Princes being excommunicated, doth wickedly and leaudly; ſhewing himſelfe therby to be that man of ſinne.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:7884:125"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Hitherto we haue heard of the dealing of the Church, both priuate and publike, with a ſtubborne ſinner, euen to the excommunicating of him from all the publike exerciſes of the Church: Now what are the cauſes, that the Lord vſeth theſe medicinall meanes, for the recouerie of ſuch a ſinner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The cauſe is double: firſt, in regard of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: ſecondly, in regard of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How in regard of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe that his holy name and religion ſhould not be euil ſpoken of, by ſuffering wicked and vnclean perſons in the Church; as blaſphemers, adulterers, &amp;c. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 7.</note> For if in houſes of good report, a proud perſon, detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or liar (much leſſe a drunkard, or filthie perſon) is not ſuffered: then ſurely ought not ſuch an one to bee in the Church, which is the houſe of the liuing God, leſt the Goſpell come by reproch through ſuch; ſeeing godleſſe perſons would thereby take occaſion to open their mouthes againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How in regard of men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That is of two ſorts: firſt, in regard of other men: for if ſuch remaine in the Church and bee not baniſhed, other men would bee in danger to bee infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with thoſe ſinnes, and not feare to offend: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apoſtle compareth a ſcandalous perſon to leauen, for as a little leauen will ſowre the whole batch; ſo one wicked man will infect the whole Church. Likewiſe the weake would thereby take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of falling away from the truth; and others (yet without) would hereby be holden from comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which is the other regard?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is in regard of the perſon excommunicated, for the bringing of him to repentance; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7884:126"/> ſaith of the inceſtuous perſon, that he ſhould bee cut off, for the deſtruction of the fleſh. 1. For the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of his naturall corruption, and for ſauing the ſpirit, that is, The inward man and regenerate. 1. Cor. 5. 5. 1. Tim. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Thus farre of medicinall Cenſures: Which is the Cenſure of reuenge and puniſhment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is the moſt fearfull thunder-clap of Gods iudgement, pronounced by the Church againſt one, which (after knowledge of the truth) is a blaſphemer of Gods word, a railor, a deſpiſer, a perſecutor of Chriſt in his Church; euen ſuch a one as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our affirmeth to haue ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt.

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Vnto whom are we to pray?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Vnto God alone. Eſa. 42. 8. &amp; 49. 11. Rom. 10. 14.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, wee haue neither precept nor example of any Saint, that called vpon, and prayed to any but vnto God.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> By what power and ſtrength doe we pray?</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51. 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Iud.</hi> 20.</note> vnto God) but by the power and motion of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſanctifying our hearts, and drawing from them this holy ſeruice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What motiues haue wee to ſtirre vs to this dutie of Prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, God hath <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 7.</note> commanded this ſeruice, and that it ſhould be performed <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 140. 18.</note> continually, that is, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſet times, without intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he hath appointed prayer as a meanes, vnto which he hath tied the procuring and obtaining of thoſe graces, which he intendeth to beſtow vpon vs; ſo that it is as a key, to open therewith the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes of all Gods treaſures, and (as it were) the onely hooke whereby wee reach all the bleſſings of God, which otherwiſe would be out of our reach. So that as the couetouſneſſe of Popiſh Prieſts gaue occaſion of a reprochfull prouerbe: <hi>No pennie, no prayer:</hi> the truth of God on the contrary ſide, doth teach vs, <hi>No prayer, no pennie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, without prayer, the vſe and enioying of all
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7884:128"/> things we haue is vnlawfull. For as when we take any <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5.</note> thing that is our neighbors without asking him leaue, we are theeues and vſurpers: ſo to lay our hands vpon any thing that is Gods (whoſe all things are) without asking them at his hand, is a ſpirituall kind of fellonie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by this meanes wee haue the more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; feeling wrought in vs, that thoſe good things that wee enioy or receiue, wee haue them from God, and not by accident or Fortune. Pſal. 50. 15.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, prayer is a ſpeciall meanes to appeaſe Gods anger towards vs, and to make way to his fauour, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any ſpeciall ſinne we haue prouoked him. Pſalm. 6. and 51.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they are in Gods eſtimation, as Incenſe and ſweet perfumes are to men, exceeding gratefull and acceptable. Pſal. 141. 2. Reuel. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can God ſo infinitely wiſe, take any ſuch delight in our weake and ſimple prayers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe in <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</note> Chriſt he taketh vs for his children; as therefore parents take more pleaſure to heare their owne children ſtammer, then others to ſpeake elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently: ſo doth the <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14.</note> Lord take pleaſure in the prayers of his children, how weake ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not God often beſtow his benefits without prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea ſomtimes he beſtowes benefits on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, either to prouoke them to repent, or to make them inexcuſable; or vpon his children (as a louing father vſeth) becauſe of their ignorance, though they bee negligent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the parts of prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Petition, and thankſgiuing. Philip. 4. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is Petition?</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:7884:128"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> A part of prayer, whereby we deſire any thing that may bee prayed for by Gods word; and it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for things of this preſent life, with this exception, ſo farre forth as the ſame ſhall be thought good by the wiſedome of God; or (and <hi rend="sup">b</hi> that eſpecially) for the things of the life to come, &amp; that without exception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> With what minde and affections are wee to make our petitions to God?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Secondly, with an earneſt deſire that God would ſupply them. Pſal. 130. 1. &amp; 143. 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, with confidence, that (if the fault be not in our ſelues) they ſhall bee ſupplied. 1. Ioh. 5. 14. 15. Mark. 11. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is thankſgiuing?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a righteous thing with God to puniſh ſinne with ſinne; and ſo to caſt a ſinner into further ſinnes by way of iuſt puniſhment: therefore wee deſire God not to giue vs ouer to our ſelues by withdrawing his ſpirit from vs: as when men doe delight in lies, hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them ouer to beleeue lies; and for Idolatrie, men <note place="margin">2. <hi>Thoſſ.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24.</note> are often iuſtly puniſhed with corporall filthineſſe in the ſame degree. Now being naturally prone to ſinne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this readineſſe (by the iuſt iudgement of God) is ſtrengthened, how ruſh wee into all euill? euen as a horſe into the battell, to whom we put the ſpurres; or as an Eagle fleeth to her prey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can it be ſhewed out of the Scripture, that God hath a hand, whereby he gouerneth euen the tranſgreſsions that are done againſt his holy will?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is expreſſely ſaid, that God did ſend <hi>Ioſeph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">

Wherein God is ſaid to haue had a further and a ſtronger hand in his ſending into Egypt, then his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and therefore it is manifeſt that God did that well, which the Patriarches did ſinfully. Hitherto is referred that which is ſaid, that it was of God, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 15.</note> hearkened not to the people. Alſo that it is ſaid that God had commanded <hi>Shimei</hi> to curſe <hi>Dauid;</hi> and <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10.</note> that the diuell was bidden of God, (ſitting in the ſeate of his righteous iudgement) to bee a lying ſpirit in the <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 19. 20. 23.</note> mouthes of the falſe Prophets.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth God any more then ſuffer ſuch things to bee done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He ſuffereth them indeed; but this is not an idle permiſſion, as ſome imagine, but ioyned with a worke <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But doth not this draw God to ſome ſtaine of ſinne, from which he is moſt free, as that which hee hateth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In no wiſe: for God is the author of euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28.</note> and the diuell and our concupiſcence the authors of the euill in it: as he that rideth on a lame horſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to ſtirre, but is not the cauſe of his halting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can God haue a hand in theſe things, and yet be free from ſinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As a cunning workman, with an ill toole can worke artificially; and a skilfull Apothecarie make a ſoueraigne medecine of the vipers fleſh; ſo the Lord can guide and order the poyſonfull ſinnes of men in ſuch ſort, as they ſhall turne to his glory, and good of the Church; and yet cannot therein be charged with ſinne, no more then the Apothecary with poyſoning, in ſo gouerning the poyſon, as it doth the contrary by his skill, to that which by nature it would haue done.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But how are theſe actions of the wicked diſcerned from the worke of God in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, from the cauſe from whence the action commeth: for <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren of enuie ſent him into Egypt, but God of loue.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How elſe is Gods working in theſe actions diſcerned from the working of the wicked?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the end whither they tend: for <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſent him, to the end hee ſhould not come to the honour he foretold out of his dreame: but God ſent him to prouide for his Church, and to fulfill that was foretold. <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed, to driue <hi>Dauid</hi> to deſpaire; but God directed him for exerciſe of <hi>Dauids</hi> patience. The diuell lied in the falſe Prophets, to ruine <hi>Achab;</hi> but God iuſtly to puniſh him for his Idolatrie. <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> to ſatisfie the deſire of his young beardleſſe counſellors: but God to performe the word that hee

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But were it not better to ſay, that theſe things were done by Gods permiſsion only, then by his prouidence and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, thereby to auoid an abſurditie in Diuinity, that God is the author of ſinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is moſt true, that God is not the author of ſin, whereof he is the auenger: As true it is alſo, that they are done by Gods permiſſion: but it is not an idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſeparated from the prouidence and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; and therefore the diſtinction of Gods permiſſion, ſeparated from his gouernment in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wicked men, is not good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe this diſtinction doth not defend the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, for the which it is deuiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How may that appeare?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If he permit ſinne, he doth it againſt, or with his will: if hee doe it againſt his will, then is hee not Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, as one that cannot let that which hee would not haue done. If with his will, how can his Iuſtice be defended, if there were not ſome good thing, for which he doth willingly permit it?

               <p>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31. 13. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 11.</note> God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> It is thought that vowes are ceremoniall, and not to pertaine to the times of the Goſpell?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are indeed very good and worthie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that thinke ſo; which doe ſo much the more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of vowes, becauſe they haue been ſo much abuſed in Poperie; howbeit it ſeemeth by this place, that for
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7884:152"/> the generall, it is a conſtant and perpetuall ordinance of God, as ſhall appeare, though not ſo neceſſarie as vnder the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are we to make our vowes to God only?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, to him alone, to whom wee owe all that wee haue, and who is the ſearcher of the hearts, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 17. 23. 21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 24.</note> hath power to puniſh the breach of a vow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who are fit perſons to make a vow?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Such onely as are iuſtified before God, and reconciled vnto him, otherwiſe their gifts and vowes cannot pleaſe him, and alſo ſuch as haue iudgement and knowledge to diſcerne of a vow, and are free and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 3. 5.</note> at their owne liberty, to performe the vow they make. Therfore thoſe, which cannot performe their vowes in regard of their ſubiection to others, as wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>Num.</hi> 30. 4. 6. 7.</note> ſeruants, &amp;c. are to take heed, that they vow not any thing that is in their hands, vnder whom they are, to infringe or hinder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What learne we hence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That in making of a vow, we haue a reſpect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ability that God hath giuen vs, &amp; that calling which he hath placed vs in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ought to be the matter of our vowes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, thoſe things or actions that are in our choyce, and in our owne power to giue or performe, it being a folly to promiſe that vnto God, which wee are not able to performe, as the Papiſts doe, in vowing perpetuall abſtinence from marriage, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, things lawfull, it being a double indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, to promiſe to doe that which he hateth and forbiddeth to be done; as the Iewes did that vowed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 14.</note> to kill <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, thoſe things which are of ſome worth and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7884:153"/> acceptance, and not baſe, and vile, or contemptible matters, ſuch as neither God nor man maketh any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of; it argueth a baſe eſteeme of God, to promiſe vnto him, by way of ſpeciall thankfulneſſe, any vile or contemptible matter. And what thankfulneſſe can it bee vnto God to pay ſuch a vow, or what comfort in his trouble can any man take, by a purpoſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof?</p>
               <p>Such things as imply no contempt or light regard of any of thoſe creatures of God, which he hath made and appointed both in his wiſedome and goodneſſe, for our vſe; as when the cauſe of ſuch and ſuch meats, either alwaies, or vpon ſuch and ſuch dayes are abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our vowes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, thoſe things which are either parts of Gods worſhip in themſelues, or furtherances thereof, or of any part of his Law: as founding of Lectures, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Colledges and Schooles, for maintenance of true religion &amp; learning, and building Almeſ-houſes, and ſuch like workes of mercie and piety, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the poore, and that with ſome ſtraine of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the end of vowes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, in generall the glory of God, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his worſhip, or the profit of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in ſpeciall, either to teſtifie our ſpeciall thankfulneſſe to God for bleſſings receiued, Gen. 28. 20. Ioſh. 6. 10. or to chaſtiſe our ſelues to preuent Gods wrath. 1. Cor. 11. 31. or to make vs more warie &amp; heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thoſe ſins that we haue formerly fallen into; or to bind our ſelues the more ſtrongly to obedience, or to ſtrengthen the weakneſſe of our faith and hope, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the dutie of thoſe that haue vowed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, to haue a diligent care to performe their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 11.</note> vowes, elſe wee deale worſe with God, then wee dare deale with many men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not to delay the performance of them. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is the neceſsity of performing vowes ſo great, that it may not be omitted, or put off in no caſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for to the end that a greater and more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 35. 9. 10. 11.</note> duty may bee performed, a man may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his vow for a time, and after returne to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation thereof, and yet be no vow-breaker: as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites for ſafety of their liues, came and dwelt in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, notwithſtanding a former vow, that they would not dwell in any houſe; and yet God witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that their vow was not broken therby: ſo to help our neighbours in ſome preſent neceſſity, wee may <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 7.</note> ceaſe from any vowed duty at that time, and not ſin. Wherein the Papiſts greatly faile, who hauing vowed vnlawfully, yet think they may not intermit the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If a man in vowing, doe not conſider ſufficiently of the greatneſſe of the matter, may be not breake that vow, if he hath not ſo aduiſedly made it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: the vow being otherwiſe lawfull; in this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4.</note> caſe, his raſhneſſe is to bee repented, but the vow muſt be kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are we to learne of all this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we be aduiſed what we vow, and not after we haue made them, to find ſome ſtarting hole where to get out, but either let vs not vow at all, or remember our vowes, and diligently performe them in their due time.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is the truth of this doctrine cleared?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Apoſtle declareth it by comparing the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3-8.</note> Church, which is the myſticall body of Chriſt, vnto the naturall body of a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many waies doth this compariſon hold?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Sundry waies: Firſt, as in the perfect body of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, there is ful furniture of al members needful to the diſcharge of their ſeuerall duties; which are knowne both how many they are, and what they are: ſo it is in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What gather you of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that as a ſuperfluous member in a mans
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7884:158"/> body, as two thumbs, or a finger more then ordinarie in one hand, is a blemiſh and deformity in the body: euen ſo ſuperfluous members muſt needs be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a blemiſh and deformity in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What further?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As the want of any naturall member breeds griefe in the body: ſo the want of any the appointed members in the Church, muſt needs bee faultie and grieuous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Proceed to the other points of the compariſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As in the body to haue a member miſplaced, as to haue an eye where the noſe ſhould be, or a foot for the hand, cauſeth both horror and griefe: ſo the like diſorder in the Church of Chriſt muſt needs bee grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and horrible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein doth this compariſon further hold?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That as in the body of a man, euery member hath his owne ſeuerall function to diſcharge, and no member can well and fitly diſcharge the dutie of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So it muſt be in the Church of God. And as all the ſeuerall members of the body are knit and vnited to their head: ſo are all the members of the Church vnto their head Chriſt. Further, as in the naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy euery ſeuerall member, is (as it were) the member of euery other in ſeruing to their good; as the eye doth ſee, the hand doth take, the mouth doth ſpeake for the good of any other member. So it is in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the parts of a particular Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Such as haue preeminence, and ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who are thoſe that haue preeminence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thoſe whom Chriſt hath appointed for the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7884:158"/> continuance of the Churches (which were builded by the extraordinarie officers) to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What things are common to all theſe ordinarie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that they bee vnblameable of life, which being required of all Chriſtians, is in greater meaſure required of them, as being the lights of the Church. Secondly, examination, whether they haue gifts, for the diſcharge of that ſpeciall office they are called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Thirdly, a calling, conſiſting partly in the election of the Church, directed by the gouernours thereof; and partly in ordination by the ſaid gouernours, which by prayer and laying on of hands, are to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate and ſeparate them to that function, with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the aſſiſtance of God, in doing their dutie faithfully.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are either ſuch as deale in the miniſtery of the word, <hi>viz.</hi> Paſtors and teachers, or aſſiſtants vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the miniſtery of the word?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A holy and ſpirituall calling, wherein men are <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How proue you, that by prophecy is meant there the office of interpreting the word, rather then of foretelling things to come?</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:7884:159"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, becauſe prophecy is ſet downe there, as a perpetuall office in the Church, wherof <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>When prophecie faileth, the people periſh.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 29. 18.</note> is charged to continue in prophecying, whereas no Prophet continued alwaies in foretelling. Thirdly, For that this prophecie conſiſteth in teaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is it added, that he muſt doe it to the edification of the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To teach, that a Miniſter in his ſermons ſhould <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. 5.</note> not vſe profound ſpeculations of Philoſophie, ſtrange languages, and ſuch like oſtentation of learning; but that he ſhould ſo labour to ſpeake, that as well hee that cleaueth wood, as he that ſitteth on the throne, euen the ſimpleſt ſhould vnderſtand, and learne what is the good will of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it ſufficient, that the Miniſter of the word bee able to teach?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; there is further required of them, that they <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.</note> be no new and greene plants in the Church of God, but ſuch as by a long abode in the Church, may bee as timber well ſeaſoned; and therefore fit to beare the ſtreſſe and waight of the miniſterie in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What further?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That (as in other reſpects) ſo in regard of the waight of their charge, they are to be ſeuered (as much as may bee) from all other offices and charges in the Common-wealth. And certainly if a man were neuer ſo well graced of God, yet the miniſtery of the word <note n="d" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.</note> alone (if faithfully diſcharged) would be imployment enough for him, which requireth the whole ſtrength of a man: and if the <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That as they are Gods mouth in preaching the word to the people; ſo they are the peoples mouth to God in prayer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the tokens further off?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A generall Apoſtaſie vnder the Antichriſt of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.</note> Rome, as the Apoſtle teacheth, 2. Theſſal. 2. 3-13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat was the occaſion of this doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It may ſeeme ſome of the Theſſalonians miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued theſe words in his former Epiſtle, <hi>viz. That we which liue, and remaine at the Lords comming, ſhall not preuent them that are dead;</hi> as if the Theſſalonians, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, ſhould liue till then: which bred this errour among them, that the day of Iudgement was at hand: and this in his ſecond Epiſtle hee confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, by putting them in mind, that firſt there muſt bee a generall Apoſtaſie, or falling away from the truth of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVas it not a tolerable errour, conſidering that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be ſtirred vp vnto greater care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for God will haue iuſt things done iuſtly, and no truth can bee well builded vpon falſhood. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7884:162"/> this, a ſubtill practice of Satan appeareth in it: that when they had long looked for the day, and ſaw no alteration of things, nor other appearance of it, they might fall into a flat vnbeleefe, that no ſuch thing ſhould come to paſſe at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it meant, that the whole Church ſhall fall from Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for it is impoſſible that a perfect head ſhould be without a body at any time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is it then called generall?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Goſpell hauing been vniuerſally preached throughout the world, both whole nations did fall from it, and the moſt part alſo euen of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that kept the profeſſion of it; howbeit, ſtill there remained a Church, although the eſtate thereof was not publikely knowne to the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat are the parts of this Apoſtaſie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The head and members; the head of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie is Antichriſt; the members his ſubiects and vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals: for as Chriſt is the head of the true Church, which is his body; ſo is Antichriſt the head of thoſe which ſhall fall away, and they his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who is this Antichriſt and his body?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Pope, and the Church of Rome vnder him, as by the Apoſtles deſcription following, doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then this Apoſtaſie is as large and generall as Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But how is it likely, that the Lord ſhould ſuffer ſo many nations as liued vnder Poperie, and that ſo long, to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Why not? and that moſt iuſtly: for if the whole body of the Gentiles were reiected, when the Church was onely in Iurie for ſome fourteene hundred yeers:
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7884:163"/> and ſeeing euen of the Iewes, ten tribes were reiected, and of the remainder, but a few were of the Church; with great reaſon hath the Lord reiected thoſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and people for ſo many ages, ſeeing they reiected Gods grace in falling away from the Goſpell, which the Lord moſt graciouſly reuealed vnto them, paſſing by their fathers that were before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is this Antichriſtian head deſcribed vnto vs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, he is deſcribed what he is towards others: and then what he is in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is he towards others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That is declared by two ſpeciall titles, of <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>ſonne of perdition;</hi> declaring hereby, not ſo much his owne ſinne, and perdition, which is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great; as of thoſe that receiue his marke, whom he cauſeth to ſinne, and conſequently, to fall into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who is often branded with the marke of cauſing Iſrael to ſinne: and hee is ſo much more deteſtable then he, by how much both his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is more execrable, and hath drawne more King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes after him, then <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did Tribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what reſpect is hee called the man of ſinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that he cauſeth many to ſinne: and this the Pope doth in a high degree; iuſtifying ſinne, not by ouerſight, but by lawes aduiſedly made; not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ſome ſins, which wee are by our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prone vnto, as ſpirituall fornication; but alſo (to the great prophanation of the holy name and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt) permitting and teaching for lawful, ſuch as euen our corrupt nature (not wholly ſubuerted through enormeous cuſtome of ſin) abhorreth, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous marriages, and breaking of faith, and leagues, equiuocating, and the like, which prophane men (by
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7884:163"/> the very light of nature) doe deteſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what ſenſe is he called the child of perdition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not as the vnthrift mentioned in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 32. <hi>John</hi> 17. 12.</note> neither as <hi>Iudas,</hi> who is paſſiuely called the ſonne of perdition; but actiuely, as it is otherwhere expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, where hee is called the deſtroyer, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reuel.</hi> 9. 11.</note> many: and that the Pope is ſuch a one, ſome of his owne ſecretaries make it good; confeſſing that many that were well diſpoſed perſons, before their entrie into that See, became curſed and cruell beaſts, when once they were ſetled in the ſame: as if there were ſome peſtilent poyſon in that ſeat, infecting thoſe who ſit therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat learne you of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the calling of the Pope is vnlawfull: for euery office or calling which the Lord doth not bleſſe, or wherein none occupying the place, groweth in piety, is to be eſteemed for an vnlawful calling; for in a lawfull calling, ſome (at the leaſt) in all ages are found profitable to the Church, or Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the vſe of all this doctrine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That whoſoeuer are partakers of the ſinnes of Rome, are alſo vnder the ſame curſe; and therefore ſuch of vs as haue liued in Poperie, ſhould examine our ſelues if wee haue truly repented vs of it: firſt, by the change of our vnderſtanding; as whether wee haue growne in the knowledge of the truth: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the change alſo of our affections; as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee hate Poperie, and loue the truth vnfainedly. And ſo let euery one iudge himſelfe, that hee bee not iudged, and that with harder iudgement, according as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</note> God hath been the longer patient towards vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat further?</p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:7884:164"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> That there can be no ſound agreement betwixt Poperie, and the profeſſion of the Goſpell; no more then betwixt light and darkneſſe, falſhood and truth, God and Belial: and therefore no reconciliation can be deuiſed betwixt them: for if the members of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall be deſtroyed, wee cannot in any ſort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with them in their errours, vnleſſe wee will beare them companie in their deſtruction alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why? doth euery errour deſtroy the ſoule?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No verily: for as euery wound killeth not a <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> man; ſo euery errour depriueth not a man of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but as the vitall parts being wounded or infected, bring death; ſo thoſe errours that deſtroy the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points &amp; heads of faith, bring euerlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: in which kinde is Poperie, which ſundry waies ouerthroweth the principles and grounds of our holy faith; and therefore is tearmed an Apoſtaſie, or departure from the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not then impoſsible for a Pope to be ſaued?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, it is not impoſſible, his ſinne being not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily againſt the holy Ghoſt, to which only repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is denied: for ſome (in likelihood) haue entred into, and continued in that See ignorantly; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may poſſibly find place to repentance. But if any be ſaued, it is a ſecret hidden with God: for concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any thing that appeares by the end of any one Pope, ſince hee was lift vp into the Emperours chaire, and diſcouered to be the man of ſin, there is no groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hope giuen to perſwade, that any one of them is ſaued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> So much of the Antichriſt, what he is towards others. What is he in himſelfe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That is ſet downe in two points: firſt, in that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7884:164"/> (contrary to right, and by meere vſurpation) hee ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe in the Temple of God, as if hee were Chriſts vicar, being indeed his enemie; both which the word <hi>Antichriſt</hi> noteth. Secondly, in that he is here expreſſely named an Aduerſarie, and one that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein is the Pope aduerſarie vnto Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Euery way; in life, and in office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How in life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that Chriſt being moſt pure and holy, yea ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe it ſelfe; the Popes, many of them, are, and haue been moſt filthie and abominable, in blaſpheming, coniuring, murthering, couetouſneſſe, whoring, and that inceſtuouſly, and Sodomitically, and yet will they in their ordinarie titles be called holy; yea holineſſe it ſelfe, which is proper onely to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How in office?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, in his kingdome: Chriſts kingdome is without all outward ſhew or pompe; but the Popes kingdome conſiſteth wholly in pompe and ſhewes, as imitating his predeceſſors, the Emperors of Rome, in his proud, ſtately, and lordly offices, Princely traines, and outragious expences in euery ſort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in his Prieſthood, in raiſing vp another ſacrifice then Chriſts, another prieſthood then his, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediators then him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in his Propheticall office, in that he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cleane contrary to him: Chriſt taught nothing but what he receiued of his Father: the Pope ſetteth out his owne canons and decrees of Councels: and in them hee teacheth ſuch doctrine, as ouerthroweth the maine foundation of that which Chriſt taught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the ſecond effect?</p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:7884:165"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he is exceedingly lift vp againſt all that is called God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth this agree to the Pope?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> More fitly then to any other perſon: for Chriſt being very God, abaſeth himſelfe vnto the aſſuming of the nature of man: the Pope a vile man, aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himſelfe to the throne of God. Chriſt being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ſecular power, paid tribute, and was taxed, and ſuffered himſelfe to bee crowned with a crowne of thornes, and bare his owne croſſe: But the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder all ſecular power, exalteth himſelfe aboue all ſecular powers; exacteth tribute of Kings; ſetteth his foot on the necke of Emperours; carrieth a triple crowne of gold, and is borne vpon mens ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But he calleth himſelfe the ſeruant of ſeruants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though hee doe, yet by the confeſſion of his owne Canoniſts (he doth it) but diſſemblingly, and in hypocriſie, which is double iniquitie: for they ſay, that he doth in humility onely ſay ſo, not that hee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſo as he ſaith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the effects of this his pride?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are two: firſt, he ſitteth in the Church as God; for he bindeth the conſciences of men by his decrees, which no Princes lawes can doe: for though men obſerue not ſuch lawes, yet if they breake them not of contempt, they are diſcharged, if they beare the penaltie preſcribed in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By this it ſeemeth, that the Church of Rome is yet the Church of God, although corrupt, ſeeing it is ſaid, that hee ſitteth in the temple of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No verily: but it is ſo ſaid, firſt, becauſe it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the name of the Church; for the Scripture giueth the name to a thing according to that it hath been: as
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7884:165"/> when Chriſt ſaith, the abomination of deſolation ſhal ſtand in the holy place; he meaneth not, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was then holy, which at that time (being no figure nor ſhadow of Chriſt, and his Church) was propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that it had been holy: ſo wee confeſſe there hath been a true Church in Rome, which is now no Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Satan. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he is ſaid to ſit in the Temple of God, becauſe hee exerciſeth his tyrannicall rule in the Chriſtian world, and is moſt buſie in thoſe places where Chriſt hath his Church, and the Goſpell is profeſſed, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all places, either by himſelfe or his wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to ouerthrow or corrupt, poyſon or hinder the free courſe of the Goſpell: ſo that in this regard he may bee ſaid to ſit in the Temple of God, that is, to raigne and tyrannize in the Church of God; and yet the city (where hee is) bee <hi>Sodome,</hi> and the Church, wherof he is head, the ſynagogue of Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the other effect of his pride?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He boaſteth that he is God, as the Popes flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Canon law call him, Our Lord God the Pope. Neither doth his pride ſtay there, but alſo hee challengeth to himſelfe things proper to God; as the title of holineſſe; alſo power to forgiue ſinnes, and to carrie infinite ſoules to hell, without checke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolement; and to make of nothing, ſomthing; yea, to make the Scripture to bee no Scripture, and no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be Scripture at his pleaſure; yea, to make of a creature the Creator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> It may ſeeme to be an impoſsible thing, that men ſhould be carried away from the faith of the Goſpell, by one ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and directly oppoſite to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It might ſeeme ſo indeed, if at once and at a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7884:166"/> hee had ſhewed himſelfe in ſuch foule colours; and therefore by certaine degrees of iniquitie, hee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe to this height of wickedneſſe, and did not at the firſt ſhew himſelf in ſuch a monſtrous ſhape and likeneſſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the Apoſtle, who in this place ſheweth of two courſes the diuell held to bring this to paſſe; one ſecret and couert, before this man of ſinne was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the other, when he was reuealed, and ſet vp in his ſeate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What difference is there betwixt Chriſts miracles, and theirs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very great euery way: for Chriſts miracles were true, whereas theſe are falſe and lying, and by legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. Chriſts miracles were from God; but theirs, where there is any thing ſtrange, and aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reach of men, from the diuell. Chriſts miracles were for the moſt part profitable to the health of man, but theirs altogether vnprofitable, and for a vain ſhew.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What gather you of this?</p>
               <p>That ſeeing the Popes Kingdom glorieth ſo much in wonders, it is moſt like that he is Antichriſt; ſeeing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 12.</note> the falſe chriſts, and the falſe Prophets ſhall doe great wonders, to deceiue (if it were poſſible) the very elect, and that ſome of the falſe prophets propheſies ſhall come to paſſe; wee ſhould not therefore beleeue the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 3.</note> doctrine of Poperie, for their wonders ſakes, ſeeing the Lord thereby trieth our faith, who hath giuen to Satan great knowledge and power to worke ſtrange things, to bring thoſe to damnation, who are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto it. Moreouer, whatſoeuer miracles are not profitable to ſome good, neither tend to confirme a truth, are falſe and lying; ſo that as the Lord left an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident difference betweene his miracles, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 12.</note> of the Egyptians; ſo hath hee left an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent difference betweene the miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and thoſe of the Romiſh Synagogue.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:7884:167"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are not miracles as neceſſarie now, as they were in the time of the Apostles?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No verily: for the doctrine of the Goſpell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then new vnto the world, had need to haue been confirmed with miracles from heauen; but it being once confirmed, there is no more need of miracles; and therefore we keeping the ſame doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, muſt content our ſelues with the confirmation which hath already been giuen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ariſeth out of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the doctrine of Poperie is a new doctrine, hauing need to be confirmed with new miracles; and ſo it is not the doctrine of Chriſt, neither is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by his miracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What force ſhall the miracles of Antichrist haue?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Maruellous great, to bring many men to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; God in iuſt reuenge of the contempt of the truth, ſending a ſtrong deluſion vpon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Hitherto we haue heard Antichriſt deſcribed by his effects and properties. Now tell me where is the place, where he ſhall haue his ſeat of ſpeciall reſidence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That is the City of Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth that appeare?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, becauſe hee that <hi>letted</hi> at the time when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, was the Emperour of Rome, who did then ſit there, and muſt bee diſſeated (as the learnedeſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelues grant) ere the Pope could enter vpon it. Secondly, <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth that City where he muſt ſit, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. 18.</note> the Ladie of the world; which at that time agreed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Rome, being the mother Citie of the World. Thirdly, it was that City that was ſeated vpon ſeuen hilles; which by all ancient records belongeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17 9.</note> and onely to Rome. As for the occaſion of the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7884:167"/> Popes placing there, it came by the meanes of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſeate of the Empire from Rome to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople; from whence enſued alſo the parting of the Empire into two parts; by which diuiſion it being weakened, and after alſo ſundred in affection, as well as in place, was the eaſier to bee entred vpon, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What doe you further gather of that the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>he that letteth ſhall let?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the Antichriſt is not one particular man, as the Papiſts doe phanſie: for then by the like phraſe he that letteth muſt bee one particular man; where it cannot be that one man ſhould liue ſo many hundred yeeres; as from <hi>Pauls</hi> time, to the time of the tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empire from Rome; much leſſe vntill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two yeeres and a halfe of the latter day, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the time of Antichriſt. And therefore as by him <hi>that letteth,</hi> is vnderſtood a ſucceſſion of Emperours, not one man alone; ſo by Antichriſt the man of ſinne is vnderſtood, a ſucceſſion of men, and not one onely man. So in <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. 3. 17. the foure beaſts, and the foure Kings doe not ſignifie foure particular men, but foure gouernments; in euery one whereof there were ſundry men that ruled. So that the argument of the Papiſts, who vpon the words <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> would proue, that the Antichriſt the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, is one ſingular man, is but vaine, and hath no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But how can Antichriſt bee already come, ſeeing the Empire yet ſtandeth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The name of the Empire onely remaineth, the thing is gone: for hee hath neither the chiefe Citie, nor the tribute, nor the commandement of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:7884:168"/> and therefore he can bee no let to the Antichriſts comming, eſpecially the Pope hauing gotten ſuch an vpper hand vpon him, as to cauſe him to waite at his gate barefoot, and to hold his ſtirrop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſhall be the end of this Antichriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God ſhall confound him with the breath of his mouth; that is, with the preaching of the word: which ſerueth for an other argument to proue the Pope to be Antichriſt: for wheras he had ſubdued Kingdoms and Empires vnder his feet, he hath been of late migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſuppreſſed by the word preached, and not by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force, as other potentates vſe to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What learne you of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The maruellous power of Gods word to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. 5.</note> whatſoeuer riſeth againſt it: for if the mightieſt cannot ſtand before it, much leſſe the ſmalleſt: and therefore it is expreſſed by a mighty wind, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth all before it; and by fire, which conſumeth all, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 2. 3.</note> and pierceth all. And it declareth a maruellous eaſie victorie againſt the enemies, when it is ſaid, that with the breath of his mouth hee ſhall conſume his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That before the laſt day he ſhall not bee vtterly conſumed; whereof notwithſtanding it followeth not that the head ſhall remaine till then: for the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet ſhall bee taken, and caſt into the fire before the latter day: but ſome ſhall retaine a liking of him, and his errours and ſuperſtitions, euen till the laſt day.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> That there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two things eſpecially: firſt the errour; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the remedie againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the errour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it ſhall be ſaid, heere is Chriſt, or there: for there ſhall be falſe Chriſts, which ſhall pretend the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon of Chriſt, otherwiſe then Antichriſt, who tearmeth himſelfe the vicar of Chriſt. Theſe alſo ſhall haue their miniſters; namely, falſe Prophets, which ſhall get credit vnto the falſe Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat learne you by this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the Church of God ſhall be put vnder tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: firſt, of their knowledge and vnderſtanding, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can diſcerne betweene errour, and truth: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of their loue and fidelity; whether after they know the truth, they will ſticke by it, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat doe you note of this kind of errour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The danger of it, in that it maketh ſhew of the corporall preſence of Chriſt, whereunto we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally greatly giuen; as appeareth, not onely by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, but by the holy Apoſtles themſelues, which were too much addicted to the corporal preſence of Chriſt: ſecondly, alſo by reaſon of the great meanes they ſhall haue to preuaile, through the wonderfull miracles they ſhall doe; eſpecially conſidering that the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God ſhall not haue (for any warrant we haue out of the word) any ſuch power, as hath already been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat further doe you learne of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The extreame impudencie of the diuell in thoſe daies, which hath neuer been heard of before, that ſhal
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7884:170"/> ſo poſſeſſe the ſpirit of a ſinfull mortall man, that hee ſhall take vpon him to be the ſonne of the moſt High: for notwithſtanding there were many, that tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to bee the Meſſias; before and after the firſt comming of our Sauiour Chriſt; yet they imagining the Meſſias to be a bare man, were neuer ſo impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrogant, as to challenge to themſelues to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naturall ſonne of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What note you of this, that</hi> if it were poſſible, the very elect ſhould be deceiued?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, the certainty of their happie eſtate, from whence they cannot fall. Secondly, that the ſame hath a foundation, not in any thing that is in men, but in the purpoſe and counſell of God, which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> So much of the errour. VVhat is the remedy againſt it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, an admonition; then, a confutation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the admonition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, not to goe out, that is, ſo certainly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of the vntruth of the thing, notwithſtanding the greatneſſe of the miracles, as not once to enquire after it: for thoſe that haue itching eares, and wanton rolling eyes, to heare and ſee things, are oftentimes by Gods iuſt iudgement deceiued, although they haue a purpoſe to the contrary. Secondly, although by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome particular calling, they bee conſtrained to be preſent at the place where ſuch are, or otherwiſe bee brought forcibly vnto them; yet not to beleeue them when they ſee or heare thoſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the confutation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it cannot bee Chriſt, that they ſhould goe out into the wilderneſſe to ſee: firſt, becauſe hee ſhall
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7884:171"/> come with great brightneſſe, as the lightning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the Eaſt, and ſhineth vnto the weſt; neither ſhall one need to goe vnto the wilderneſſe to ſee him: becauſe his light ſhal be ſeene in all places of the world alike. Secondly, he will not come on the earth, but will ſhew himſelfe in the aire only. Thirdly, he ſhall come ſuddenly, as in a moment; wheras before he had ſpace to goe from place to place. Fourthly, neither ſhall it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile then to goe out after and ſeeke him; becauſe as ſpeedily as the Eagles are gathered to the dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe; ſo the children of God, being compared vnto Eagles, ſhall ſuddenly bee gathered to our Sauiour Chriſt; who is compared to a dead body, in reſpect of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> So much of the tokens which come within an age of the latter day. What are the nearest tokens, or rather ſuch as are ioyned with the ſecond comming of Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The neareſt are, that the Sunne ſhall bee dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and the Moone ſhall not giue her light; the Starres ſhall fall from heauen, the Sea ſhall rore terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the earth ſhall tremble; and in a word, all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of heauen and earth ſhall be ſhaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> At what time ſhall theſe ſignes come to paſſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Immediately after the falſe Chriſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which (as hath been ſpoken) ſhall raiſe vp a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous errour, and by meanes thereof great vexation; and therefore it is ſaid, after the tribulation of thoſe daies, ſhall the immediate ſignes of the comming of Chriſt be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the cauſe of theſe ſignes appearing, and of the comming of Chriſt immediately vpon them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The faithfull prayers of the Saints of God, which cry vnto him to make an end of theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7884:171"/> wicked dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is not the day and houre of the comming of Chriſt reuealed vnto man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No verily; man may gather by the ſignes going before, that it is not far off; but the day and the houre no man knoweth, no not the Angels. <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not that there is any want of loue in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, in conceiling the day of his comming, for as much as the Angels, who are ſaid to bee full of eyes in <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But how can that bee, that hee which gouerneth all things, ſhould be ignorant of that day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As he is God he knoweth it; but not as he is the ſonne of man, eſpecially vnglorified; that is to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his aſcenſion into heauen.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>VVhat is meant by this,</hi> that one generation ſhall not paſſe till all be fulfilled? Mat. 24. 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That as it was ſaid before, that one generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould not paſſe, vntill the deſtruction of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem were accompliſhed, which indeed was effected about fortie yeeres after. So it is likely that after all the ſignes aforeſaid, before one age ſhall paſſe, the day of Iudgement aforeſaid ſhall come.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore is this vehement aſſeneration vſed,</hi> That heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my words ſhall not paſſe away? Mat. 24. 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Againſt thoſe mockers, which ſhal come in the latter times, and ſhall charge the miniſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell with vntruth, becauſe they ſee no alteration in the courſe of nature.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the reaſon of this concealement?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that the Lord thereby might trie the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of men, whether they would be ſo impudently bold, as to go about to breake open the ſecret cloſet of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that by this concealement, we might bee made more watchfull; for as the harlot is ſaid to bee the bolder to commit wickedneſſe, becauſe the day of her husbands returne was ſet and appointed by him: ſo it would fare with vs. <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Generally the world ſhall be drowned in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as was the old world in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the flood; and as was Sodome imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the fire and brimſtone came downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat gather you of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That thereby the Lord will take a triall of the conſciences of his children, whether they will bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the inticements of theſe pleaſures, as before he tooke triall of their knowledge by the falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets; and withall by this courſe he diſpoſeth of the means, wherby the wicked may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly periſh, in that thoſe whom one miſchiefe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7884:172"/> doth not entangle, another may reach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why? ſhall theſe things ſpoken of, bee imputed as if they were ſinnes, ſeeing they are both lawfull and neceſſarie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> True it is, that eating and drinking, and giuing to marriage, buying, and ſelling; planting, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, are in their owne nature lawfull and neceſſarie; but our Sauiour Chriſt meaneth the abuſe of theſe things; and thereby declareth, that a great condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be due vnto thoſe things, which before men are not condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth it appeare that hee meaneth the abuſe of theſe things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, by the Hebrew phraſe of eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which being vttered in the preſent time, noteth a continuance of eating and drinking. Secondly, from the Euangeliſt <hi>Lukes</hi> manner of vtterance of them, without any copulatiue conioyning of them, on this manner: <hi>They ate, they dranke, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded;</hi> that is to ſay, they were exceſſiuely, and aboue meaſure, giuen ouervnto theſe things. Like bruit beaſts, from whom (ſome thinke) this metaphor is borrowed, that eate all the day, and ſome part of the night. As in the matter of buying &amp; ſelling, when <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 18. 19.</note> men doe employ themſelues ſo much therin, that they cannot attend to the ſeruice of God. So in building, when men build exceſſiuely; that is, further then their <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> ability, calling, or manner of the countrey wherein they liue will affoord. And in the matter of marrying, and giuing to marriage, when the children of God ſhall take <note n="a" place="margin">Gen...</note> vnto them prophane women, ſuch as their eyes like beſt. Or when men doe ioyne themſelues in Matrimonie for liuing, or parentage only, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of religion. Or when men liue vnchaſtly euen in

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Security, careleſneſſe, and ſenſuality, liuing as meere naturall men; yea as very bruit beaſts and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in the world,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that it is ſaid, that as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> notwithſtanding they were forewarned of the flood, both by the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Arke; yet as men being caſt into a deepe ſleepe; they cried peace, peace, vnto themſelues, vntill the floud ſwallowed them vp: ſo it ſhall bee in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daies, that men ſhall bee ouertaken ſuddenly, (as a woman with child) with the iudgment of God, when they thinke all to be well with them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we ſhould not deferre the time of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, vntill wee ſee the neareſt ſignes of the latter day; as the darkening of the lights of heauen, and the roring of the ſeas; for as much as they will miniſter greater matter of feare vnto vs, then of conuerſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are to bee watchfull, and to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, becauſe they know not what houre hee will come; which our Sauiour vrgeth by a ſimilitude of an houſholder, which if hee knew what houre the theefe would come, he would ſurely watch: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much more ſhould we watch, becauſe in an houre that we thinke not, will the Sonne of man come.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the firſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The parable of the ten Virgins. Matth. 25. 1-14.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat difference is there betwixt this parable, and others tending this way?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very little, or none at all: for as the other doe ſolicite vs to watch both for the day and houre of Chriſts comming, that wee bee not ſurpriſed at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; ſo this parable doth teach how dangerous it is, and how deſperate our eſtate ſhall be, if we be careleſſe thereof; and withall preſſeth that ſame point eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of watching, euen for the houre or moment when our Sauiour Chriſt commeth.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the dulneſſe of our capacities, and the corruption of our affections is ſuch, that we are hardly lifted vp from earth to heauenly meditations; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed vp, we are ready of our naturall weakneſſe, eftſoones to fall: in which regard, the multiplying of parables, are as helpes to lift and vphold our affections to the meditation of the former doctrines concerning his ſecond comming; beſides the weight and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the matter is ſet forth by the number of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> From whence is this parable of the tenne Virgins ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is borrowed from the manner of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7884:174"/> where our Sauiour taught; where a maide giuen <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 15.</note> to marriage had her maidens, and the bridegroome his yong men, which gaue attendance on them; fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bride from her friends to his houſe; which was done it the night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the meaning of this parable?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the bridegroome, is ſignified our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, whoſe ſpouſe is the Church; and by the ten Virgins, are meant the profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, profeſſing their attendance vpon Chriſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat did the Virgins, to declare their diligence in waiting for his comming?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They tooke with them their lamps, whereby they made profeſſion of their attendance and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancie of his comming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVherein ſtandeth the wiſedome of the wiſe Virgins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that before their ſlumber, (that is, before the day of their death, or before their change at the latter day) they labour to prouide themſelues of ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as ſhall not forſake them when they come to iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein ſtandeth the follie of the fooliſh Virgins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not that they had not the light of any of Gods graces in them at all; but that all the light they had, was of that kind that dieth with them, not being the graces of true faith, ſanctification, and repentance: ſo that when they were to bee changed, or raiſed in the latter day, they haue no ſauing grace at all found in them, whereby they might with boldneſſe appeare before the Iudge of all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other parable is there, whereby Chriſt teacheth vs to prepare for his comming?</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſame in effect with the other of the ten Virgins; for as there was in the other a bridegroome, and a bride; virgins wiſe, and fooliſh; the wiſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the other reiected: ſo heere there is a maſter, and his ſeruants; of whom, ſome be faithfull, and ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull; the faithfull plentifully rewarded, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull iuſtly puniſhed: yet this doth more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prepare vs to his comming, then the former.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe it hath more arguments then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Firſt, in that they had receiued their maſters goods, wherof they were to giue an account: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that their iuſt reward is more liuely declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the parable?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the meaning of the parable?</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not Chriſt beſtow his graces vpon his Church, before his aſcenſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes no doubt; but the graces which hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed after his aſcending, did farre exceed the other.</p>
               <p>

               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:7884:175"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, the exceeding mercy of God, in giuing ſo liberally vnto his ſeruants: and ſecondly, his wiſdome, in giuing more to ſome, and leſſe to others, and yet to the leaſt a talent; that is to ſay, very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the vſe of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, if a faithfull ſeruant will bee carefull for the account of periſhable money; much more ought we, for the Lords ſpirituall treaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſecondly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If they grudge not at the meaſure of others, much leſſe ſhould wee grudge at the greater graces of God in other men: and if they reſted in their maſters wiſedome and iudgement, who might faile, much more ſhould wee reſt in the iudgement of our God, who cannot faile; nay rather, wee are aſſured, that whatſoeuer hee beſtoweth vpon any one, is for the good of all: for euery one hath his portion in other mens gifts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If God beſtowed his gifts according to the quality of men, then there is deſert in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not ſo: for although ſome naturall men excell others in wit and iudgement, whereby they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the diſcharge of their temporall affaires; yet <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 13.</note> it is not ſo in the ſpirituall, ſeeing the beginning, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and perfection therof is the free gift of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did they occupie their talents?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He that receiued fiue, gained fiue more; and he that receiued two; gained likewiſe two more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What learne you of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the gaine ſhould bee anſwerable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; and therefore that no man ſhould meaſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by another mans foot, as if it were enough to doe as others doe: but as God hath meaſured out his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> to vs, ſo ſhould we practice; neither ought he that receiues but two talents, to take an occaſion to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe he cannot doe ſo much as others which haue receiued fiue; but to labour faithfully, according to the gifts which God hath beſtowed vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What further ariſeth out of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That a Chriſtian man ought to know the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his gifts (ſo that he bee neither proud nor deie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thereby) the better to know his account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did all that receiued talents gaine accordingly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for the third receiuing but one talent, hid it in the ground vntill his maſters returne, and did not vſe it at all; which ſetteth out the naughtineſſe, ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and vnfaithfulneſſe of euill ſeruants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why did he chuſe to ſet downe their vnfaithfulneſſe in the leaſt, and not in the moſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe otherwiſe men failing in the leſt, would thinke this fearfull iudgement not to belong vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is this iudgement proper onely to the ſlothfull?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; it agreeth as well to all thoſe that ſeeke their owne gaine, and not their Lords, how earneſt ſoeuer they ſeeme to bee in the vſe of their gifts, eating the bread of carefulneſſe, and drinking the water of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Hitherto of the talents, and the vſe of them. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider you in the accounts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that the day of account ſhall come, although the time (indeed ſhort) ſeeme long in our opinion. Therefore we muſt continue without fainting, in the earneſt practice of godlineſſe: for if the certainty of the maſters comming maketh the ſeruant watchfull, who notwithſtanding may die before his maſter come home, and his maſter alſo die before the taking of accounts; much more ſhould wee continue our watch, who are vndoubtedly aſſured of the comming of Chriſt, and of our appearance before him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee muſt labour to bee found faithfull in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: for though an earthly maſter may bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his accounts; yet our maſter Chriſt cannot bee deceiued: and if good ſeruants haue been found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though they haue been ſure not to be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; let vs much more be faithfull, being aſſured of <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 12. 15.</note> our accounts which we ſhall giue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the reward of the faithfull ſeruants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Twofold; one in honour, another in ioy: the honour was firſt in word, of praiſing and calling them faithfull ſeruants, which is an excellent thing, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comming from God: and ſecondly, in deed, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them a ſingular rule and preferment ouer others, according to their degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the reward in ioy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In partaking their maſters ioy, which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable, and ſuch as none can conceiue, but they onely who enioy it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe our Sauiour will haue them to fit with him to iudge the wicked; therefore hee fitteth them thereunto, by clearing them firſt, 1. Cor. 6. 2. Reuel. 3. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What gather you of this order?</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What elſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That life euerlaſting is called a kingdome; and therefore euery godly one ſhall be made partaker of a moſt glorious kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How commeth this kingdome? by grace, or deſert?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the onely grace of God in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Declare the ſame more euidently?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, it is the bleſſing of God; and therefore of grace. Secondly, it is giuen to vs as to heires, not as the wages of a ſeruant, which commonly deſerueth more then a ſonne. Thirdly, it was prepared for vs from the beginning of the world; and therefore is of the meere loue of God, and not of merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> So much of the ſentence. What is the reaſon of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When Chriſt was an hungred, they fed him; when he was a thirſt, they gaue him drinke; when he was naked, they clothed him; when he was ſicke, and in priſon, they viſited him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not this reaſon plainly ſtrengthen the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of merits?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not ſo, ſeeing <hi>(for)</hi> importeth not heere the <note place="margin">For.</note> cauſe, but the effect: as wee ſay, Summer is come, for
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7884:182"/> flowers doe ſpring; and, It is a good tree, for it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good fruit; theſe are effects and not cauſes. Moreouer, if Chriſt would haue taught merit; then would he haue choſen the greateſt and chiefeſt works; as of his owne worſhip in the firſt table: elſe ſome might iuſtly complaine that they were not rewarded, according to the meaſure of their good workes, hauing yeelded a greater obedience to the firſt table then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhy then doth Chriſt chooſe thoſe workes of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe they are moſt manifeſt to the world; following therein the cuſtome of earthly Iudges, who inſiſt moſt vpon plaineſt proofes, either to conuince the guiltie, or cleare the innocent: ſo Chriſt pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his ſentence rather according to workes, then to faith, and thoſe of the ſecond table, rather then of the firſt; becauſe workes are more viſible, then faith; and it is eaſier to play the hypocrite in the obedience of the firſt table, then of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth Chriſt here vſe ſo long a catalogue of theſe workes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To teach vs to exerciſe mercie in all thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and not content our ſelues with any one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How could they doe theſe things vnto Chriſt, whom moſt of them did neuer ſee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When they did any of them to his poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41.</note> then they did it vnto him.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat gather you of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That ſeeing it was a great honour to lodge An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at vnawares in ſtead of ſtrangers: this is a far more excellent honour whereunto Chriſtians are called; being aſſured that in receiuing ſuch poore as are there
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7884:182"/> ſpoken of, they receiue Chriſt himſelfe; which ſhould ſtirre vp the bowels of mercy and compaſſion in vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; ſeeing not ſo much as a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 42.</note> ſhall be vnrewarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> So much of the former ſentence. What is the latter againſt the wicked?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Depart from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the diuell and his Angels,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the equitie of this ſpeech?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is likewiſe anſwerable to their owne deſerts, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Iob</hi> 21. 14.</note> who in their life thruſt away from them the day of the Lord, and (as it were) bid Chriſt depart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When doe the wicked ſay ſo to Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When they refuſe to know his will; when they diſdaine the miniſterie, are vnmercifull to the poore, and the ſtranger, or the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the parts of this his iudgement?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, to be depriued of Gods preſence, as it is a great part of glory to bee continually in his preſence. Secondly, to be euerlaſtingly tormented in hell fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the reaſon of this ſentence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is (cleane contrary to the former) for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thoſe duties vndone which the godly did. And although the good workes of the godly were not the cauſes of ſaluation; yet theſe euill workes are the very next cauſe of damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can that be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the beſt workes of the godly are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly good, and cannot deſerue life: but the euill workes of the euill, are perfectly euill; and therefore deſerue death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is to be conſidered in their anſwere?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Their exceeding blindneſſe whiles they liued
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7884:183"/> here, in that they neuer conſidered that in reiecting the poore, they reiected Chriſt.</p>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though if he ſpeake of the wicked by themſelues, and of the godly by themſelues, it may bee truly ſaid, that neither all the wicked, nor all the godly ſhall awake out of the duſt: becauſe ſome of both ſorts ſhall not die, but be changed onely. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51.</note>

And as God beſtowing greater graces vpon one heere in this life, more then vpon another, is not therefore eſteemed to haue beſtowed them in regard of merit: ſo in beſtowing greater glory in the life to come, vpon one more then another, is not to be eſteemed to doe it for merit; but that which hee doth, is onely of meere and free grace in Ieſus Chriſt, in and through whoſe merits hee beſtoweth vpon his elect the degrees of bleſſedneſſe aforeſaid, as it hath been formerly taught vnto vs: Wherefore to him alone, and to his meere mercy bee giuen all the praiſe and glory for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
